* Condensed Trace Table Legend
All the items in this table labeled N-X are placeholders for actual node id values,
actual values will be N-1, N-2, N-3, etc. up to the number of nodes in the cluster. Yes, One based, not zero.

| Column Label | Description     | Details                                                                                        |
| Event Node   | Triggering node | The id value of the node that experienced the event that triggered this trace row              |
| N-X Role     | Raft Role       | FLWR = Follower CNDI = Candidate LEAD = Leader                                                 |
| N-X Op       | Activity        | Describes a traceable event at this node, see separate table below                             |
| N-X Delta    | State change    | Describes any change in state since previous trace, see separate table below                   |


** "Op" Column detail legend
| Value          | Meaning                                                                                      |
| STARTED        | Simulated node starting with empty log, term=0                                               |
| CMD START      | Simulated client requested that a node (usually leader, but not for all tests) run a command |
| CMD DONE       | The previous requested command is finished, whether complete, rejected, failed, whatever     |
| CRASH          | Simulating node has simulated a crash                                                        |
| RESTART        | Previously crashed node has restarted. Look at delta column to see effects on log, if any    |
| NEW ROLE       | The node has changed Raft role since last trace line                                         |
| NETSPLIT       | The node has been partitioned away from the majority network                                 |
| NETJOIN        | The node has rejoined the majority network                                                   |
| endtries->N-X  | Node has sent append_entries message to N-X, next line in this table explains details        |
| (continued)    | li=1 means prevLogIndex=1, lt=1 means prevLogTerm=1, ci means sender's commitInde            |
| (continued)    | ec=2 means that the entries list in the is 2 items long. ec=0 is a heartbeat                 |
| N-X->ent_reply | Node has received the response to an append_entries message, details in continued lines      |
| (continued)    | ok=(True or False) means that entries were saved or not, mi=3 says log max index = 3         |
| give_vote->N-X | Node has sent request_vote to N-X, term=1 means current term is 1 (continued next line)      |
| (continued)    | li=0 means prevLogIndex = 0, lt=0 means prevLogTerm = 0                                      |
| N-X->vote      | Node has received request_vote response from N-X, yes=(True or False) indicates vote value   |


** "Delta" Column detail legend
Any item in this column indicates that the value of that item has changed since the last trace line

| Item | Meaning                                                                                                                         |
| t=X  | Term has changed to X                                                                                                           |
| lt=X | prevLogTerm has changed to X, indicating a log record has been stored                                                           |
| li=X | prevLogIndex has changed to X, indicating a log record has been stored                                                          |
| ci=X | Indicates commitIndex has changed to X, meaning log record has been committed, and possibly applied depending on type of record |
| n=X  | Indicates a change in networks status, X=1 means re-joined majority network, X=2 means partitioned to minority network          |
