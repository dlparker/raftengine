state_machine_command.minimal_node_count
----------------------------------------

This is the log replication scenario where not all cluster nodes are running and reachable, but
just enough of them are running and communicating with the server to allow log record replication
to succeed. For example, two nodes ready in a three node cluster, or three nodes in a five node
cluster.
