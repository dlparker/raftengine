This feature branch provides testing infrastructure that uses persistent storage mechanisms (such as SQLite) instead of in-memory storage. This enables testing scenarios that require data persistence across node restarts and system failures.

**Key Persistent Storage Capabilities**:

- **Durability Testing**: Validates that data survives node restarts and system crashes
- **Real Storage Behavior**: Uses actual database storage to catch issues that memory-only tests might miss
- **Recovery Scenarios**: Enables testing of complex failure and recovery patterns
- **Performance Validation**: Tests realistic storage performance characteristics

**Testing Benefits**: Persistent storage testing provides confidence that the Raft implementation works correctly with real storage systems and can handle the durability requirements of production deployments.
