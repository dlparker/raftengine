This feature provides granular control over message transmission and delivery in distributed system testing, enabling precise orchestration of communication patterns to create specific test scenarios and validate system behavior under controlled conditions.

Message flow control addresses the fundamental challenge in distributed systems testing: the need to control the timing, ordering, and delivery of messages between nodes to create deterministic test conditions that would be difficult or impossible to achieve with natural network timing.

**Core Control Mechanisms**:

**Individual Message Control**:
- `do_next_out_msg()`: Process exactly one outgoing message from a node's queue
- `do_next_in_msg()`: Process exactly one incoming message to a node
- `forward_msg()`: Explicitly control delivery of specific messages
- `hold_msg()`: Prevent specific messages from being delivered

**Queue Management**:
- **Outgoing Queue Control**: Manage messages waiting to be transmitted
- **Incoming Queue Control**: Control messages waiting to be processed
- **Message Buffering**: Hold messages in transit for controlled release
- **Selective Delivery**: Choose which messages to deliver and when

**Execution Stepping**:
- **Single-Step Execution**: Advance system state by exactly one message
- **Deterministic Progression**: Ensure repeatable test execution
- **State Validation Points**: Examine system state between each message
- **Controlled Race Conditions**: Create specific timing scenarios

**Advanced Control Patterns**:

**Message Interleaving**:
- Control the order in which messages from different nodes are processed
- Create specific interleaving patterns to test edge cases
- Validate system behavior under different message ordering
- Test race condition handling and concurrent operation resolution

**Delayed Delivery Simulation**:
- Hold messages for specified durations to simulate network delays
- Create realistic timing patterns for performance testing
- Validate timeout handling and retry mechanisms
- Test system behavior under varying network conditions

**Selective Message Blocking**:
- Block specific message types while allowing others to flow
- Create partial communication failures for resilience testing
- Simulate asymmetric network conditions
- Test system recovery from communication disruptions

**Batch Control Operations**:
- Control groups of related messages as atomic units
- Ensure consistent state transitions across message groups
- Validate transaction-like behavior in message processing
- Test compound operation handling

**Testing Applications**:

**Election Scenario Control**:
- Control RequestVote message delivery timing to create split votes
- Ensure specific vote ordering for deterministic election outcomes
- Validate election safety under controlled message patterns
- Test edge cases in leader election protocols

**Replication Testing**:
- Control AppendEntries message delivery for log replication testing
- Create specific log state configurations through message control
- Validate conflict resolution under controlled conditions
- Test follower synchronization patterns

**Partition Simulation**:
- Block messages between specific nodes to simulate network partitions
- Control partition healing through selective message release
- Validate behavior during partition and recovery phases
- Test split-brain prevention and resolution

**Failure Recovery Testing**:
- Control message delivery during node failure and recovery scenarios
- Validate system behavior during partial failures
