Network Blocking provides testing infrastructure to simulate network partitions and communication failures by selectively blocking network traffic to specific nodes.

This testing feature enables controlled simulation of network failures, allowing comprehensive testing of distributed system behavior under various connectivity scenarios:

1. **Selective Blocking**: Block network communication to/from specific nodes
2. **Partition Simulation**: Create network partitions between node groups
3. **Recovery Testing**: Unblock networks to test recovery scenarios
4. **Timing Control**: Control when blocking/unblocking occurs during test execution
5. **State Isolation**: Isolate nodes to test independent behavior

**Key Testing Capabilities**:
- Simulate complete network isolation of individual nodes
- Test behavior during network partitions and minority isolation
- Validate recovery mechanisms when connectivity is restored
- Control message delivery timing for deterministic test execution
- Create complex network topology scenarios

**Usage Patterns**:
- Block target nodes during power transfer to test timeout handling
- Isolate leaders to trigger election processes
- Partition clusters to test split-brain prevention
- Test node recovery after network isolation

This feature is essential for testing distributed consensus algorithms under realistic network failure conditions, ensuring the system maintains safety and liveness properties even during network disruptions.
