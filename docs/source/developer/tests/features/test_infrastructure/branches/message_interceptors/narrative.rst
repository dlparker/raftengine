This feature branch provides testing infrastructure for intercepting and controlling message flow during test execution. Message interceptors allow precise control over message timing and delivery for testing complex scenarios.

**Key Interceptor Capabilities**:

- **Message Capture**: Interceptors can capture incoming or outgoing messages for inspection
- **Controlled Delay**: Messages can be held and released at controlled times to simulate network delays
- **Conditional Processing**: Interceptors can apply logic to determine which messages to intercept
- **Async Coordination**: Interceptors integrate with async/await patterns for proper test coordination

**Testing Benefits**: Message interceptors enable testing of race conditions, timing-sensitive scenarios, and complex message ordering situations that would be difficult to reproduce reliably without precise control.
