Event Handler Management provides testing infrastructure for registering, managing, and controlling event handlers during test execution.

This testing feature enables comprehensive validation of the event system by allowing tests to dynamically register event handlers, monitor system events, and verify correct event generation:

1. **Handler Registration**: Dynamically add event handlers to monitor specific event types
2. **Handler Removal**: Remove event handlers during test execution
3. **Event Monitoring**: Capture and validate event generation during tests
4. **Multi-Handler Support**: Register multiple handlers for different event types
5. **Handler State Tracking**: Monitor handler state and invocation counts

**Key Testing Capabilities**:
- Register custom event handlers for specific test scenarios
- Monitor role changes, term changes, and leader transitions
- Track election operations and log resync activities
- Validate event data integrity and serialization
- Remove handlers to test partial monitoring scenarios
- Verify correct event handler lifecycle management

**Usage Patterns**:
- Register handlers before operations to monitor behavior
- Use counters and saved data to validate event generation
- Remove handlers to test different monitoring configurations
- Verify proper cleanup and handler management

This feature is essential for testing the event system itself and ensuring that applications can reliably monitor Raft operations through the event interface.
