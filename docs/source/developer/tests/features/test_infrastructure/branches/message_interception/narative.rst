This feature branch validates the test infrastructure's ability to intercept and control message delivery between nodes, enabling precise testing of distributed system behaviors and edge cases.

The message interception capability allows tests to selectively delay, drop, reorder, or modify messages between specific nodes. This enables testing of network partition scenarios, message timing dependencies, and various failure conditions that would be difficult to reproduce in real network environments.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Selective Interception**: Messages between specific nodes can be intercepted
- **Delivery Control**: Intercepted messages can be delayed, dropped, or reordered
- **Precise Timing**: Message delivery timing can be controlled precisely
- **Scenario Recreation**: Complex distributed system scenarios can be recreated reliably

**Test Scenario**:
Tests intercept vote request messages from candidates to create specific timing scenarios, such as preventing a candidate from receiving enough votes before discovering higher terms, enabling validation of complex election edge cases.
