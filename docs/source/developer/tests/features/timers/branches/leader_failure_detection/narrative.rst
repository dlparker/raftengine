This feature branch validates that followers can detect leader failures through election timeout mechanisms and automatically initiate new elections when the leader becomes unresponsive or fails.

**Key Leader Failure Detection Behaviors**:

- **Timeout Detection**: Followers detect leader absence when heartbeats stop arriving within the election timeout period
- **Automatic Response**: Followers automatically transition to candidate state when timeout is reached
- **Term Advancement**: Failed leader detection results in term increment and new election initiation
- **Cluster Recovery**: The system maintains availability by electing a new leader when the current leader fails

**Availability Requirements**: Leader failure detection is critical for maintaining cluster availability and ensuring that the system can continue operating even when the current leader becomes unavailable due to network partitions, crashes, or other failures.
