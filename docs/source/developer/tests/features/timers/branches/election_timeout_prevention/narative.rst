This feature branch validates that properly configured heartbeat and election timeout values prevent unnecessary elections when the leader is functioning correctly. This ensures cluster stability and availability.

**Key Behaviors**:

- Followers do not timeout when receiving regular heartbeats
- Election timeout is properly reset by heartbeat reception
- Cluster remains stable over extended periods
- No spurious elections occur with proper timing configuration

**Stability Requirements**: The relationship between heartbeat interval and election timeout must be properly maintained to ensure cluster stability while enabling rapid failure detection.
