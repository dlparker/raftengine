This feature branch validates the leader's heartbeat timer mechanism that drives periodic AppendEntries messages to followers. The heartbeat timer ensures cluster stability by preventing followers from timing out and initiating unnecessary elections.

**Key Operations**:

- Periodic timer firing based on configured heartbeat interval
- Automatic generation of AppendEntries messages to all followers
- Timer reset behavior after successful message transmission
- Proper timing coordination with election timeout values

**Timing Requirements**: The heartbeat timer must fire at intervals significantly shorter than follower election timeouts to maintain leader authority and cluster stability.
