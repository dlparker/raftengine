This feature category covers Raft's timeout and timer mechanisms described throughout Diego Ongaro's Raft thesis, particularly in sections covering leader election timeouts and heartbeat intervals. Proper timer management is essential for Raft's liveness properties and availability guarantees.

**Key Timer Operations**:

- **Heartbeat Timers**: Leaders sending periodic heartbeats to maintain authority and prevent elections
- **Election Timeouts**: Followers detecting leader absence and initiating new elections
- **Timeout Prevention**: Proper heartbeat timing to prevent unnecessary elections
- **Leader Detection**: Followers recognizing leader loss through timeout mechanisms
- **Candidate Timeouts**: Candidates handling split votes through randomized timeout retry

**Timing Relationships**:

Raft requires careful coordination between heartbeat intervals and election timeouts to ensure cluster stability. Heartbeat periods must be significantly shorter than election timeouts to prevent false leader loss detection.

**Availability Properties**:

Properly configured timers ensure cluster availability by enabling rapid leader detection failure while preventing unnecessary elections that could cause temporary unavailability.
