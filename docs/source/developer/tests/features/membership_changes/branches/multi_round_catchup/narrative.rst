This feature branch validates the multi-round log catchup process for new cluster members with extensive log histories requiring multiple communication rounds to achieve consistency.

**Key Multi-Round Behaviors**:

- **Large Log Handling**: Manages addition of followers that require extensive log catchup operations
- **Round-Based Progress**: Tracks progress through multiple rounds of log replication to achieve consistency
- **Catchup Coordination**: Coordinates between leader and new follower across multiple message exchanges
- **Progress Validation**: Ensures each round achieves appropriate progress toward full log consistency

**Safety Requirements**: Multi-round catchup ensures that new members with significant log lag can be safely integrated into the cluster without overwhelming message queues or creating performance bottlenecks during the membership change process.
