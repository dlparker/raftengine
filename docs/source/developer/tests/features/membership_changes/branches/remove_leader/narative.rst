This feature branch validates the coordinated removal of a leader node from the Raft cluster. This is a complex operation that requires the leader to step down and trigger a new election while ensuring cluster continuity.

**Key Operations**:

- Leader initiates its own removal via `exit_cluster()` call
- Leader steps down from leadership role
- Remaining followers detect leader absence and initiate election
- New leader is elected from remaining cluster members
- Removed leader cleanly shuts down its Raft operations

**Coordination Challenges**: Leader removal requires careful timing to ensure that the cluster doesn't lose availability during the transition. The removed leader must coordinate its departure to minimize disruption to ongoing operations.
