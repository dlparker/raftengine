This feature branch validates the abort and failure handling mechanisms for membership changes when operations cannot be completed successfully due to resource constraints or excessive operational complexity.

**Key Abort Behaviors**:

- **Round Limit Enforcement**: Enforces maximum number of log catchup rounds before aborting membership changes
- **Resource Protection**: Prevents infinite loops or excessive resource consumption during membership operations
- **Graceful Failure**: Provides proper notification and cleanup when membership changes must be aborted
- **Event Notification**: Ensures proper event and callback notification when membership changes fail or are aborted

**Safety Requirements**: Membership change abort mechanisms ensure that failed operations do not leave the cluster in an inconsistent state and that all participants are properly notified of the failure, allowing them to take appropriate recovery actions.
