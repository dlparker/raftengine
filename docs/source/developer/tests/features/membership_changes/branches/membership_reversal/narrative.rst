This feature branch validates the reversal and rollback mechanisms for membership changes when leader crashes or other failures occur during the membership change process, ensuring cluster consistency.

**Key Reversal Behaviors**:

- **Crash Recovery Handling**: Properly handles leader crashes during membership change operations
- **Log Consistency Restoration**: Ensures log consistency when membership changes are interrupted
- **State Rollback**: Properly rolls back partial membership changes that cannot be completed
- **Pending Node Cleanup**: Cleans up pending node state when membership changes are reversed

**Safety Requirements**: Membership change reversal mechanisms ensure that incomplete or failed membership operations do not leave the cluster in an inconsistent state, properly cleaning up any temporary state and ensuring all nodes maintain a consistent view of cluster membership.
