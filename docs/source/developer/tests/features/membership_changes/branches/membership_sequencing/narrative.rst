This feature branch validates that membership changes are properly sequenced and ordered to prevent conflicts and ensure cluster safety when multiple membership operations occur in succession.

**Key Sequencing Behaviors**:

- **Single Change Limitation**: Only one membership change is processed at a time to maintain cluster safety
- **Operation Queuing**: Subsequent membership changes wait for current operations to complete
- **Catchup Coordination**: Membership changes coordinate with log catchup operations to ensure consistency
- **State Transition Safety**: Proper sequencing prevents unsafe intermediate cluster configurations

**Safety Requirements**: Membership change sequencing ensures that the cluster never enters an unsafe configuration where conflicting membership operations could compromise the consensus algorithm or create ambiguous leadership scenarios.
