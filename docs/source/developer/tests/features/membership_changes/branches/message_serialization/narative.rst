This feature branch validates the serialization and deserialization of membership change messages, including MembershipChangeMessage and MembershipChangeResponseMessage. 

**Key Validation Points**:

- Message dictionary conversion maintains all essential fields
- Serialized messages can be properly reconstructed
- Response messages correctly identify their corresponding requests
- String representations include critical information for debugging

**Message Flow**: Tests verify that membership change messages can be converted to/from dictionary format for network transmission while preserving all necessary data for proper cluster reconfiguration operations.
