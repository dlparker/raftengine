This feature branch validates that nodes can be successfully re-added to a cluster after being previously removed, ensuring that membership changes can be reversed and that nodes can rejoin with proper state synchronization.

**Key Re-Addition Behaviors**:

- **Clean State Recovery**: Previously removed nodes can be cleanly restored to operational state
- **Membership Restoration**: Re-added nodes are properly integrated back into the cluster configuration
- **State Synchronization**: Re-added nodes receive current cluster state and log entries during rejoin
- **Sequence Integrity**: Re-addition operations maintain proper ordering with other membership changes

**Flexibility Requirements**: The ability to re-add previously removed nodes provides operational flexibility for cluster management, allowing temporary node removal for maintenance or reconfiguration followed by restoration to service.
