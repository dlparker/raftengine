This feature branch validates log compaction operations that occur after snapshot creation. Log compaction safely removes applied log entries that are now represented in the snapshot, reducing storage requirements.

**Key Operations**:

- Safely removing log entries up to the snapshot index
- Updating log state to reflect compacted storage
- Maintaining proper first/last index tracking after compaction
- Preserving safety invariants during compaction

**Safety Requirements**: Log compaction must preserve all information needed for safety while ensuring that the node can still participate in Raft operations with its compacted log state.
