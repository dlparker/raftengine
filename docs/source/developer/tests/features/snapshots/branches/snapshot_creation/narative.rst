This feature branch validates the creation of point-in-time snapshots of the Raft state machine. Snapshot creation captures the complete state machine state at a specific log index and term, enabling log compaction.

**Key Operations**:

- Taking snapshots at arbitrary points during normal operation
- Capturing state machine state with proper index/term metadata
- Ensuring atomicity of snapshot creation process
- Validating snapshot completeness and integrity

**Safety Considerations**: Snapshot creation must be coordinated with ongoing command processing to ensure consistent state capture without interfering with normal Raft operations.
