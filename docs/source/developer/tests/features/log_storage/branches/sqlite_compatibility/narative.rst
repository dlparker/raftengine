This feature branch validates that the Raft consensus algorithm operates correctly when using SQLite as the persistent log storage backend instead of the default in-memory storage used by most tests.

SQLite provides ACID properties and persistent storage, which introduces different behavior compared to in-memory storage:

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Transaction Atomicity**: SQLite's transaction support ensures that log operations are atomic, preventing partial writes that could corrupt the Raft log
- **Persistence Across Restarts**: Unlike in-memory logs, SQLite storage survives process restarts, requiring validation that the Raft state is correctly restored
- **Concurrent Access**: SQLite's locking mechanisms may affect performance and timing compared to in-memory operations
- **Storage Durability**: Written log entries, terms, and votes must be durable and survive system failures

**What This Tests**:

- Leader election with persistent vote storage
- Log entry replication and persistence
- Term progression tracking in the database
- Commit index advancement with database storage
- State machine command processing with persistent logs

**Expected Behavior**:

All Raft safety properties must hold with SQLite storage:
- Election Safety: Only one leader per term, with votes persisted
- Leader Append-Only: Leaders never overwrite entries in the database
- Log Matching: Database ensures consistent log content across nodes
- Leader Completeness: New leaders have all committed entries from the database
- State Machine Safety: Applied commands produce consistent results

This compatibility test serves as a foundation for validating other storage backends and helps isolate storage-related issues in more complex scenarios.
