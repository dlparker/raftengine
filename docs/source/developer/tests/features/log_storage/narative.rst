The Raft consensus algorithm requires persistent storage for the log entries, current term, and vote history to maintain correctness across node restarts and failures. The raftengine implementation provides a pluggable storage interface that allows different backend implementations.

This feature category validates that the core Raft operations work correctly with different log storage backends, ensuring that the safety properties and liveness guarantees are maintained regardless of the underlying storage technology used.

The log storage system must support:

- **Atomic writes**: Log entry persistence must be atomic to prevent corruption
- **Durability**: Written data must survive process crashes and restarts
- **Ordering preservation**: Log entries must maintain their sequential ordering
- **Term persistence**: Current term and vote information must be persistent
- **Transaction support**: Multiple operations should be atomic where required

Different storage backends may have different performance characteristics, concurrency behaviors, and failure modes, so compatibility testing ensures the Raft algorithm behaves correctly across all supported backends.
