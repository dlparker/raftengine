This feature branch validates that the cluster properly resolves conflicts between log entries with different terms at the same index, ensuring consistency when nodes have divergent log histories.

When nodes have been partitioned or leaders have failed, different nodes may have conflicting entries at the same log index with different terms. The Raft protocol must resolve these conflicts by having followers adopt the leader's log, potentially overwriting their own conflicting entries.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Conflict Detection**: Conflicting log terms at same index are detected
- **Resolution Process**: Conflicts are resolved in favor of current leader's log
- **Consistency Restoration**: All nodes eventually have consistent log state
- **Safety Preservation**: Committed entries are never lost during conflict resolution

**Test Scenario**:
After network partitions or leader failures, different nodes have conflicting log entries at the same index but with different terms. A new leader must detect these conflicts and resolve them by ensuring all followers adopt its log history, overwriting conflicting entries as needed.
