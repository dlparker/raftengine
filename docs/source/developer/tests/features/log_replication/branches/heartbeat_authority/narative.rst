This feature branch validates the system's ability to use heartbeat messages to establish and maintain leader authority in the cluster, preventing followers from starting elections and ensuring cluster stability during normal operation.

Heartbeat authority is the fundamental mechanism by which leaders demonstrate their continued viability and prevent election timeouts at followers. Regular heartbeats serve as proof of leader health and maintain the established leadership hierarchy.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Regular Heartbeats**: Leader sends periodic heartbeat messages to all followers
- **Authority Establishment**: Heartbeats establish leader's continued authority
- **Timeout Prevention**: Heartbeats reset follower election timeouts
- **Leadership Maintenance**: Continuous heartbeats maintain stable leadership
- **Cluster Coordination**: Heartbeats keep cluster synchronized under leader control
- **Election Suppression**: Active heartbeats prevent unnecessary election attempts

**Heartbeat Authority Process**:
1. Leader establishes authority through successful election
2. Leader begins sending regular heartbeat messages to all followers
3. Followers receive heartbeats and reset their election timeouts
4. Continuous heartbeats demonstrate leader's ongoing health and capability
5. Followers remain in follower state as long as heartbeats continue
6. Leader authority is maintained through uninterrupted heartbeat stream
7. Any interruption in heartbeats triggers election timeout at followers
8. Authority is transferred only when heartbeats cease and new election occurs

**Authority Properties**:
- **Periodic Timing**: Heartbeats sent at regular, predictable intervals
- **Timeout Reset**: Each heartbeat resets follower election timers
- **Leadership Proof**: Heartbeats serve as evidence of leader viability
- **Preemption Prevention**: Active heartbeats prevent election attempts
- **Cluster Stability**: Maintains consistent leadership during normal operation

**Heartbeat Behavior**:
- **Frequency Control**: Heartbeat interval shorter than election timeout
- **Broadcast Distribution**: Heartbeats sent to all cluster members
- **Content Minimal**: Heartbeats may contain minimal or no log entries
- **Authority Signal**: Primary purpose is leadership maintenance
- **Failure Detection**: Absence triggers follower election processes

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests the core mechanism by which Raft leaders maintain authority and cluster stability, ensuring that healthy leaders can continuously demonstrate their viability and prevent disruptive election attempts through regular heartbeat communication.
