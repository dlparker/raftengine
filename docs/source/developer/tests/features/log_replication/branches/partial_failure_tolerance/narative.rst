This feature branch validates that log replication can succeed and maintain cluster operation even when individual followers experience temporary failures, as long as a majority quorum is maintained.

The Raft consensus algorithm requires only a majority of nodes to agree for log entries to be committed. This feature tests scenarios where some followers may be temporarily unable to process or acknowledge log entries, but the cluster continues to operate successfully because the leader maintains communication with enough nodes to form a quorum.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Majority Quorum Operation**: Cluster continues with majority of nodes operational
- **Selective Replication Success**: Log entries commit despite individual node failures
- **Command Success Criteria**: Commands succeed when majority acknowledges, not all nodes
- **Failed Node Isolation**: Failed nodes don't prevent cluster progress

**Failure Tolerance Scenarios**:
1. Leader sends AppendEntries to all followers
2. Some followers fail to process entries due to temporary errors
3. Sufficient followers (majority) successfully acknowledge
4. Leader commits entries and notifies successful followers
5. Failed followers remain behind until they recover
6. System maintains consistency and availability throughout

This ensures that temporary individual node issues (resource constraints, transient errors, etc.) don't halt the entire distributed system, maintaining high availability as long as a majority quorum is maintained.
