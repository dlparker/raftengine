This feature branch validates the system's ability to use heartbeat messages to propagate commit index updates to followers, ensuring consistent view of committed entries across the cluster even when no new entries are being appended.

Heartbeat messages serve dual purposes in Raft: maintaining leader authority and updating followers about commit progress. When the leader has no new entries to send, it still sends empty AppendEntries messages (heartbeats) with updated commit indices to inform followers which entries are safe to apply to their state machines.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Regular Heartbeats**: Leader sends periodic heartbeat messages to all followers
- **Commit Index Propagation**: Heartbeats carry current leader commit index
- **Empty Entry Handling**: Heartbeats contain no log entries but still update state
- **Follower Commit Update**: Followers update their commit index from heartbeats
- **State Machine Application**: Followers apply newly committed entries to state machine
- **Leader Authority**: Heartbeats maintain leader's authority in the cluster

**Heartbeat Commit Update Process**:
1. Leader determines current commit index based on majority replication
2. Leader constructs AppendEntries message with zero entries
3. Leader sets commit index field in heartbeat message
4. Leader sends heartbeat to all followers in cluster
5. Followers receive heartbeat and extract commit index
6. Followers compare received commit index with their current commit index
7. If received index is higher, followers update their commit index
8. Followers apply newly committed entries to their state machine
9. Followers send AppendResponse confirming heartbeat receipt

**Heartbeat Properties**:
- **Authority Maintenance**: Heartbeats prevent election timeouts at followers
- **Commit Propagation**: Essential for distributing commit progress
- **Zero Entries**: Heartbeats contain no log entries, only metadata
- **Regular Timing**: Sent at regular intervals to maintain cluster coherence
- **Bidirectional**: Followers respond to confirm receipt and status

**Commit Index Behavior**:
- **Leader Calculation**: Leader determines commit based on majority replication
- **Monotonic Increase**: Commit index only increases, never decreases
- **Safety Guarantee**: Only entries replicated to majority are committed
- **State Machine Update**: Committed entries are applied to state machine
- **Persistence**: Commit index advances persistently affect cluster state

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests the critical mechanism by which leaders inform followers about commit progress during periods of low activity, ensuring consistent state machine execution across the cluster even without new client commands.
