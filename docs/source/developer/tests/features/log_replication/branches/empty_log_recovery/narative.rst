Empty Log Recovery validates the system's ability to recover nodes that have lost all log data and bring them back into sync with the cluster.

This feature tests extreme recovery scenarios where nodes restart with completely empty logs, requiring full log reconstruction from the cluster leader:

1. **Complete Log Loss**: Nodes restart with no log entries
2. **Full Reconstruction**: System rebuilds entire log from current leader
3. **Incremental Catchup**: Log entries are transferred incrementally for efficiency
4. **State Restoration**: Operations and application state are fully restored
5. **Automatic Recovery**: Process occurs automatically through timer-driven operations

**Key Validation Points**:
- Nodes with empty logs can rejoin and sync with the cluster
- Full log reconstruction proceeds correctly from index 0
- Application state is properly restored through log replay
- Process handles large logs efficiently through incremental transfer
- Recovery completes automatically without manual intervention
- Final state matches other cluster members exactly

**Recovery Scenarios Tested**:
- Leader crash and recovery with empty log
- Follower recovery with empty log after missing many operations
- Multi-step catchup for large log differences
- Timer-driven automatic recovery processes

This feature is critical for disaster recovery scenarios where nodes may lose persistent storage or need to be rebuilt from scratch while rejoining an active cluster.
