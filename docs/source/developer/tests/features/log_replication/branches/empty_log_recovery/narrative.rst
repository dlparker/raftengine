This feature branch validates that nodes can successfully recover and synchronize when they restart with completely empty logs, whether they are leaders or followers. This scenario tests the robustness of the log replication and catch-up mechanisms.

**Key Recovery Scenarios**:

- **Leader Recovery**: A crashed leader that restarts with an empty log must be able to catch up with the cluster through normal log replication mechanisms
- **Follower Recovery**: A crashed follower that restarts with an empty log must be able to receive and apply the complete log history from the current leader
- **Automatic Synchronization**: The recovery process should happen automatically through timer-driven operations without manual intervention
- **Consistency Verification**: After recovery, the node should have identical state to other cluster members

**Recovery Requirements**: Empty log recovery tests validate that the Raft implementation can handle complete log loss scenarios while maintaining cluster consistency and availability during the recovery process.
