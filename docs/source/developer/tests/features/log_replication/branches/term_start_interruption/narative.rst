This feature branch validates that the cluster properly handles scenarios where the process of replicating the term start log entry is interrupted by leader crashes or other failures.

When a new leader is elected, it must append a no-op entry to the log to commit previous term entries. If this process is interrupted by a leader crash, the cluster must handle the partial replication state and ensure consistency when a new leader takes over.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Partial Replication Handling**: Interrupted term start entries are handled correctly
- **State Consistency**: Cluster maintains consistency despite interruption
- **Recovery Process**: New leader properly handles predecessor's interrupted term start
- **Commit Safety**: Previous term entries are eventually committed safely

**Test Scenario**:
A newly elected leader begins replicating its term start entry but crashes before the process completes. A subsequent leader must detect this situation and properly handle the interrupted replication, ensuring all committed entries from previous terms are preserved.
