Heartbeat Processing validates the leader's ability to send periodic heartbeat messages and followers' ability to process them correctly.

This feature tests the critical heartbeat mechanism that maintains leader authority and prevents unnecessary elections in stable clusters:

1. **Heartbeat Generation**: Leaders send periodic heartbeat messages to followers
2. **Heartbeat Reception**: Followers correctly process incoming heartbeat messages
3. **Term Validation**: Heartbeats include current term information for validation
4. **Authority Maintenance**: Heartbeats maintain leader authority and reset election timers
5. **Error Resilience**: Heartbeat processing continues despite individual message failures

**Key Validation Points**:
- Leaders generate heartbeat messages at appropriate intervals
- Followers process heartbeats and acknowledge leader authority
- Heartbeat messages contain correct term and leader information
- Processing continues gracefully despite message errors or corruption
- Heartbeat failures are properly detected and reported
- System maintains stability through heartbeat communication

**Failure Scenarios Tested**:
- Message corruption during heartbeat processing
- Exceptions during heartbeat message handling
- Network issues affecting heartbeat delivery
- Invalid or malformed heartbeat messages

This feature is fundamental to Raft's leader election and cluster stability mechanisms, ensuring that stable clusters avoid unnecessary elections through proper heartbeat communication.
