This feature branch validates the system's ability to use heartbeat messages to confirm and propagate commit state information to followers after leadership transitions, ensuring all nodes have consistent commit knowledge.

Heartbeat-based commit confirmation is crucial for ensuring that followers understand the current commit state after elections, particularly when the new leader has more recent commit information than the followers. This mechanism ensures that commit state propagates correctly and that all nodes maintain consistent views of which entries are committed.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Commit State Propagation**: Heartbeats carry commit index information to followers
- **Post-Election Synchronization**: New leaders update followers on current commit state
- **Consistency Maintenance**: All nodes reach consistent commit knowledge
- **Heartbeat Integration**: Commit information embedded in standard heartbeat messages
- **State Convergence**: Follower commit indices updated to match leader's knowledge
- **Authority Confirmation**: Heartbeats confirm leader authority while updating commit state

**Heartbeat Commit Process**:
1. New leader established through election process
2. Leader has current knowledge of commit state from previous term
3. Followers may have outdated commit index information
4. Leader sends heartbeat messages containing current commit index
5. Followers receive heartbeats and update their commit indices accordingly
6. All nodes converge on consistent commit state knowledge
7. Cluster ready for normal operation with synchronized commit state

**Commit Confirmation Properties**:
- **State Synchronization**: All nodes achieve consistent commit index values
- **Information Piggybacking**: Commit updates piggyback on heartbeat messages
- **Efficiency**: No additional message overhead beyond standard heartbeats
- **Immediate Updates**: Commit state synchronized immediately after election
- **Safety Preservation**: Commit updates respect safety properties of committed entries
- **Performance Optimization**: Uses existing heartbeat infrastructure for updates

**Heartbeat Message Integration**:
- **Commit Index Field**: Heartbeats include leader's current commit index
- **AppendEntries Reuse**: Uses standard AppendEntries message format for heartbeats
- **Batched Updates**: Multiple pieces of state information in single heartbeat
- **Response Validation**: Follower responses confirm successful commit index updates
- **Error Handling**: Handles cases where commit updates cannot be applied

**Post-Election Benefits**:
- **Rapid Convergence**: Quick establishment of consistent cluster state
- **Operational Readiness**: Cluster ready for client operations immediately
- **State Machine Updates**: Enables proper state machine advancement post-election
- **Client Consistency**: Ensures consistent read responses across cluster members
- **Recovery Optimization**: Efficient recovery from leadership transitions

**Testing Validation**:
- **Commit Propagation**: Validates proper propagation of commit information
- **Consistency Checks**: Verifies all nodes have identical commit state
- **Timing Analysis**: Measures time required for commit state convergence
- **Message Efficiency**: Confirms efficient use of heartbeat messages for updates

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests the critical capability for rapid commit state synchronization after elections, ensuring that clusters can quickly return to consistent operation and serve client requests with proper consistency guarantees.
