This feature branch validates the system's ability to detect and resolve log conflicts that arise when nodes have divergent log histories, ensuring all nodes converge to a consistent log state.

Log conflicts occur when nodes have entries at the same index but with different terms, typically after network partitions where multiple leaders attempt to replicate different entries. The Raft algorithm resolves these conflicts by having followers overwrite their conflicting entries with those from the legitimate leader.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Conflict Detection**: System identifies when logs contain conflicting entries at the same index
- **Conflict Resolution**: Followers overwrite conflicting entries with leader's authoritative entries
- **Log Consistency**: All nodes eventually have identical log histories
- **Data Integrity**: Overwritten entries are completely replaced without corruption
- **State Machine Consistency**: State machines reflect the resolved log state

**Conflict Resolution Process**:
1. Leader attempts to replicate entries to follower
2. Follower detects mismatch between prevLogIndex/prevLogTerm and its log
3. Follower rejects AppendEntries request with success=false
4. Leader decrements nextIndex and retries with earlier entries
5. Process continues until matching point is found
6. Follower truncates its log from the conflict point
7. Follower accepts and appends new entries from leader
8. State machine applies commands in resolved order

**Conflict Scenarios**:
- **Term Conflicts**: Same index, different terms (most common)
- **Index Gaps**: Missing entries in follower log
- **Spurious Entries**: Extra entries in follower log
- **Complete Divergence**: Logs diverge from early point

**Resolution Guarantees**:
- **Leader Wins**: Leader's log is always considered authoritative
- **Monotonic Convergence**: Each round makes progress toward consistency
- **Safety Preservation**: No committed entries are lost during resolution

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests scenarios where followers must rewrite portions of their logs when rejoining after network partitions, ensuring the critical Raft property that logs are eventually consistent across all nodes.
