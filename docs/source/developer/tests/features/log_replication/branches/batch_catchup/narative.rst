This feature branch validates the system's ability to efficiently replicate multiple log entries in batches when followers need to catch up after periods of disconnection.

When a follower has been isolated or offline while the leader processed multiple commands, the catchup process should efficiently transfer multiple log entries rather than sending them one at a time. This batching improves performance and reduces network overhead during recovery scenarios.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Batch Size Optimization**: Multiple entries sent together when possible
- **Network Efficiency**: Reduced message overhead compared to individual entry replication
- **Progress Tracking**: Proper handling of batch acknowledgments and progress updates
- **Failure Resilience**: Graceful handling when batch transfers encounter errors
- **Catchup Completion**: Verification that all entries are successfully transferred

**Batch Replication Process**:
1. Leader identifies follower is behind by multiple log entries
2. Leader prepares batch AppendEntries with multiple entries
3. Follower receives and processes entire batch atomically
4. Follower acknowledges successful batch reception
5. Process repeats until follower is fully caught up

**Performance Considerations**:
- Batch size limited by message size constraints and memory usage
- Balance between large batches (efficiency) and small batches (responsiveness)
- Proper handling of partial batch failures requiring retry mechanisms

This feature ensures efficient cluster recovery while maintaining consistency guarantees.
