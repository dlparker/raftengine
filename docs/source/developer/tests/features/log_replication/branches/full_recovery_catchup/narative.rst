This feature branch validates the system's ability to completely restore a node's log from an empty state to full synchronization with the cluster's committed state.

This scenario occurs when nodes experience complete data loss (disk failures, corruption) or when new nodes join an existing cluster and need to receive the entire cluster history. The recovery process must efficiently transfer all committed log entries while maintaining consistency guarantees.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Complete State Transfer**: All committed log entries transferred successfully
- **Incremental Progress**: Recovery proceeds systematically from log index 1 to current
- **Resource Management**: Memory and network usage managed during large transfers
- **Consistency Preservation**: No data corruption during extended recovery process
- **Recovery Verification**: Final state matches cluster's current committed state

**Full Recovery Process**:
1. Recovering node starts with completely empty log
2. Leader identifies node needs complete log history
3. Leader begins systematic transfer from earliest log entries
4. Multiple rounds of batch transfers cover entire log history
5. Node processes and applies all transferred entries
6. Final verification ensures complete state synchronization

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Very large logs requiring multiple transfer rounds
- Network interruptions during lengthy recovery processes
- Memory constraints when processing large log histories
- Concurrent new commands arriving during recovery

**Performance Considerations**:
Recovery of large logs can be time-intensive, so the implementation should balance thoroughness with efficiency, potentially using snapshots where available to reduce transfer overhead.
