This feature branch validates the system's ability to create and replicate term start entries when a new leader is elected, establishing clear term boundaries in the log and enabling proper log consistency checks.

When a node becomes leader, it must immediately create a special "term start" or "no-op" entry in its log to mark the beginning of its leadership term. This entry serves multiple critical purposes in the Raft protocol and must be replicated to a majority of followers before the leader can safely process client commands.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Term Start Creation**: New leaders immediately append a term start entry upon election
- **Term Start Replication**: Term start entries are replicated to majority before client commands
- **Term Boundary Marking**: Logs clearly delineate between different leadership terms  
- **Log Consistency Base**: Term start entries provide reference points for consistency checks
- **Commitment Rules**: Term start entries follow standard Raft commitment semantics

**Term Start Process**:
1. Node wins election and becomes leader for new term
2. Leader immediately appends term start entry to its log
3. Leader sends AppendEntries with term start entry to all followers
4. Followers accept and append the term start entry
5. Leader waits for majority acknowledgment of term start entry
6. Only after term start is committed can leader process client commands
7. Term start entry establishes baseline for future log operations

**Term Start Properties**:
- **No-Op Command**: Term start entries contain no client-visible state changes
- **Term Marking**: Entry clearly indicates the term number it represents
- **Ordering Constraint**: Must be first entry created by new leader
- **Replication Requirement**: Must achieve majority replication before client commands
- **Consistency Anchor**: Provides fixed reference point for log comparison

**Failure Scenarios**:
- **Leader Failure**: New leader creates its own term start entry
- **Partial Replication**: Term start replication follows normal Raft rules
- **Network Partition**: Term start entries help resolve log conflicts

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests the critical initialization step that every new leader must perform, ensuring proper term demarcation and establishing the foundation for safe log replication during the new leader's term.
