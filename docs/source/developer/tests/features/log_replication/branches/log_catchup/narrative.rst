This feature branch validates the mechanisms by which lagging nodes catch up with the current state of the cluster. This includes both incremental catch-up for temporarily disconnected nodes and complete reconstruction for nodes with empty logs.

**Key Catch-up Mechanisms**:

- **Incremental Sync**: Nodes that are behind by several entries can catch up through normal AppendEntries messages
- **Bulk Transfer**: Efficient handling of large catch-up operations when nodes are significantly behind
- **Timer-Driven Operations**: Catch-up processes should work automatically through heartbeat and timeout mechanisms
- **Progress Verification**: The system should reliably detect when catch-up is complete and nodes are synchronized

**Performance Considerations**: Log catch-up tests validate that the replication system can efficiently bring lagging nodes up to date without disrupting normal cluster operations or overwhelming network resources.
