Log Catchup Mechanisms provide efficient methods for bringing outdated nodes up to date with the current cluster state.

This feature validates the sophisticated algorithms used to efficiently transfer missing log entries to nodes that have fallen behind, whether due to network issues, crashes, or being offline:

1. **Efficient Transfer**: Minimize network traffic while ensuring complete log sync
2. **Batch Processing**: Transfer multiple log entries in efficient batches
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Track catchup progress and completion
4. **Automatic Operation**: Catchup occurs automatically through timer mechanisms
5. **Scalable Design**: Handle large log differences efficiently

**Key Validation Points**:
- Missing log entries are identified and transferred efficiently
- Large log gaps are handled through batched transfer operations
- Catchup progress is monitored and tracked accurately
- Process completes automatically without manual intervention
- Final log state matches leader exactly
- Performance remains reasonable for large catchup operations

**Catchup Scenarios**:
- Small gaps from brief network interruptions
- Large gaps from extended node downtime
- Complete log reconstruction from empty state
- Timer-driven automatic catchup operations

This feature ensures that nodes can efficiently rejoin clusters after various types of disconnection or failure, maintaining cluster consistency while minimizing recovery time and network overhead.
