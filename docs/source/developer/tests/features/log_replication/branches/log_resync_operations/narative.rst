Log Resynchronization Operations handle the complex process of bringing outdated follower logs back into sync with the leader's log.

This feature validates the sophisticated log synchronization mechanisms that ensure all nodes maintain consistent replicated logs despite network partitions, node failures, or temporary disconnections:

1. **Catchup Operations**: Send missing log entries to outdated followers
2. **Backdown Operations**: Handle log conflicts by backing down to common points
3. **Incremental Sync**: Efficiently sync logs using incremental updates
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Resolve log inconsistencies between leader and followers
5. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor resync progress and completion

**Key Validation Points**:
- Missed log entries are correctly identified and transmitted
- Log conflicts are detected and resolved through backdown operations
- Resync operations proceed incrementally for efficiency
- Progress is properly tracked through resync event monitoring
- System handles complex scenarios with multiple missed entries
- Final log state is consistent across all nodes after resync

**Resync Scenarios Tested**:
- `SENDING_CATCHUP`: Leader sends missing entries to catch up followers
- `SENDING_BACKDOWN`: Leader resolves conflicts by finding common log points
- Multi-step resync processes with multiple catchup operations
- Network partition recovery with log divergence

This feature is critical for maintaining log consistency in distributed environments where nodes may temporarily lose connectivity or fall behind due to performance issues.
