Command Retry Logic validates the system's ability to handle command execution failures and provide appropriate retry mechanisms for client operations.

This feature ensures that the Raft system properly handles various failure scenarios during command processing and provides clear feedback to clients about retry requirements:

1. **Failure Detection**: System detects when commands cannot be processed
2. **Retry Indication**: Commands are marked as retry-able when appropriate
3. **State Validation**: Commands are rejected when leader is not ready
4. **Recovery Handling**: System resumes command processing after recovery
5. **Client Communication**: Clear feedback provided about command status

**Key Validation Points**:
- Commands correctly marked for retry during power transfer states
- Failed commands do not corrupt system state
- Retry logic works correctly after system state changes
- Command acceptance resumes properly after recovery periods
- Client receives appropriate feedback about command status

**Retry Scenarios Tested**:
- Commands during power transfer operations
- Commands when leader is not accepting requests
- Commands during system recovery periods
- Commands after timeout or failure conditions

This feature is essential for building robust client applications that can handle the temporary unavailability periods inherent in distributed consensus systems while maintaining data consistency and system reliability.
