This feature category encompasses all aspects of node lifecycle management in the Raft consensus system, including node startup, shutdown, crash scenarios, and recovery procedures.

Node lifecycle management is critical for maintaining cluster availability and ensuring proper state transitions when cluster membership changes due to planned maintenance or unexpected failures. These features validate that the Raft implementation correctly handles various node state transitions while preserving consensus safety properties.

**Key Areas Covered**:

- **Node Startup**: Clean initialization of new nodes joining the cluster
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup and handover procedures for planned node removal
- **Crash Simulation**: Testing behavior under unexpected node failures
- **Recovery Procedures**: Validating correct restart and state restoration processes
- **State Persistence**: Ensuring critical state survives node restarts

**Safety Considerations**:
All lifecycle operations must preserve Raft's core safety properties, ensuring that leadership transfers, log consistency, and cluster availability are maintained throughout various node state transitions.
