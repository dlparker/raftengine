This feature branch validates the system's behavior when nodes experience unexpected crashes and subsequent recovery, simulating real-world hardware failures, process termination, or operating system crashes.

Node crashes are unpredictable events that can occur at any time during cluster operation. The Raft implementation must gracefully handle these scenarios, ensuring that crashed nodes can be properly restarted and reintegrated into the cluster without compromising safety or availability.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Crash Detection**: Cluster properly detects when nodes become unresponsive
- **Continued Operation**: Remaining nodes continue operating normally after crash
- **State Persistence**: Critical state (term, vote, log entries) survives crashes
- **Clean Recovery**: Crashed nodes restart and rejoin cluster successfully
- **Consistency Maintenance**: No data loss or inconsistency from crash scenarios

**Crash Simulation Process**:
1. Node is operating normally as part of cluster
2. Simulated crash immediately terminates node operation
3. Node loses all in-memory state but retains persistent storage
4. Cluster continues operation with remaining nodes
5. Crashed node is restarted and attempts to rejoin
6. Recovery process restores node to synchronized state

**Recovery Scenarios**:
- **Leader Crash**: Triggers election, new leader takes over
- **Follower Crash**: Minimal impact, node rejoins when recovered
- **Multiple Crashes**: Tests cluster resilience under multiple failures

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature specifically tests the testing framework's ability to simulate realistic crash scenarios, ensuring test results accurately reflect real-world behavior.
