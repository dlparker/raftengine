This feature branch validates cluster behavior when individual follower nodes become isolated from the network while the leader and other followers maintain connectivity.

Unlike leader isolation which typically triggers elections, follower isolation should allow the cluster to continue operating normally since the leader retains connectivity with a majority of nodes. This scenario tests the cluster's resilience to partial network failures affecting minority nodes.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Continued Operation**: Cluster continues processing commands despite follower isolation
- **Majority Consensus**: Leader can still achieve consensus with remaining connected followers
- **Isolated Node Behavior**: Isolated follower doesn't disrupt cluster operation
- **Leader Stability**: Current leader remains stable without triggering unnecessary elections
- **Recovery Readiness**: System prepared for isolated node's eventual reconnection

**Isolation Scenarios**:
1. Single follower loses network connectivity to all other nodes
2. Leader and other followers maintain normal communication
3. Cluster continues processing commands with available majority
4. Isolated follower cannot participate in consensus decisions
5. When network heals, isolated follower rejoins and catches up

**Safety Considerations**:
- Cluster availability maintained as long as leader + majority of followers connected
- No split-brain scenarios since isolated nodes cannot form competing majorities
- Proper handling of delayed messages when isolated node reconnects
