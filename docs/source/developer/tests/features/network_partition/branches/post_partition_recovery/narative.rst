This feature branch validates proper handling of network partition recovery scenarios where nodes must discover updated terms and leadership when connectivity is restored.

When a network partition heals, nodes that were isolated may have outdated term information while nodes in the majority partition may have elected new leaders with higher terms. The recovery process must ensure that all nodes converge on the current term and leader identity through proper message exchange.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Term Discovery**: Isolated nodes learn about higher terms through message exchanges
- **Leadership Recognition**: Nodes correctly identify the current leader after partition heal
- **State Convergence**: All nodes eventually agree on current term and leader
- **Message Ordering**: Proper handling of overlapping messages during recovery phase

**Recovery Process**:
1. Network partition isolates nodes with potentially different term knowledge
2. Partition heals, allowing message exchange between previously isolated groups  
3. Nodes with lower terms discover higher terms through vote requests or other messages
4. System converges on highest term and appropriate leader

This ensures cluster consistency is restored after network partition resolution.
