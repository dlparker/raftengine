This feature branch validates Raft's behavior when network partitions resolve with message loss. When the original leader becomes isolated from the cluster and a new leader is elected, the old leader's queued messages are discarded during network recovery.

**Key Validation Points**:
- **Message Loss Handling**: Ensures that lost messages during partition do not cause inconsistencies
- **State Reconciliation**: Verifies that the old leader properly updates its state when rejoining
- **Log Consistency**: Confirms that log entries remain consistent across the cluster after recovery
- **Term Management**: Validates that the old leader recognizes the new term and steps down

This scenario simulates complete network failures where buffered messages are lost, requiring the Raft algorithm to handle state reconciliation purely through the append entries protocol when the partition heals.
