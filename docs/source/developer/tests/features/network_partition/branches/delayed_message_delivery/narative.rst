This feature branch validates Raft's behavior when network partitions resolve with delayed message delivery. This simulates scenarios where messages are not lost but severely delayed, such as when network equipment experiences temporary failures or when systems experience resource contention.

**Key Validation Points**:
- **Delayed Message Handling**: Ensures that messages delivered after partition recovery are processed correctly
- **Term Validation**: Verifies that delayed messages from previous terms are properly rejected
- **State Consistency**: Confirms that delayed message delivery doesn't cause state inconsistencies
- **Order Independence**: Validates that message processing order doesn't affect final state

This scenario is particularly important because it tests edge cases where the original leader's heartbeats and append entries messages arrive after a new leader has been elected and has started processing commands. The Raft algorithm must handle this gracefully by rejecting stale messages and ensuring the old leader learns about the new term.
