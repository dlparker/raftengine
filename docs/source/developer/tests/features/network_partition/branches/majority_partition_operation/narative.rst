This feature branch validates that a Raft cluster continues normal operations when a network partition isolates a minority of nodes, leaving the majority partition with a functioning leader and quorum.

**Key Operations**:

- Majority partition retains leadership and quorum
- Commands can be executed and committed in the majority partition
- Isolated minority nodes cannot make progress
- Log replication continues among majority partition members
- Cluster maintains availability for client operations

**Safety Guarantees**: The Raft safety properties ensure that the minority partition cannot elect a new leader or commit entries, preventing split-brain scenarios while the majority continues safe operation.
