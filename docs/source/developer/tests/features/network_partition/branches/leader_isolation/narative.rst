This feature branch specifically covers scenarios where the current cluster leader
becomes isolated from the majority of follower nodes due to network partition.

**Raft Thesis Reference**: Section 3.4 (Leader Election), Section 3.2 (Safety Properties)

When a leader is isolated from its followers:

1. **Leader Side**: The isolated leader cannot replicate log entries to followers,
   so it cannot commit new entries. It continues to believe it is the leader until
   it discovers a higher term.

2. **Follower Side**: Followers in the majority partition will timeout waiting for
   heartbeats and start a new election. One will become the new leader.

3. **Safety Guarantees**: 
   - The isolated leader cannot commit new entries (lacks quorum)
   - The new leader will have a higher term number
   - Any uncommitted entries from the isolated leader will be discarded

4. **Recovery Process**: When the partition heals, the old leader discovers the
   higher term and immediately steps down to follower status.

This scenario is particularly important because:
- It tests the quorum-based safety mechanisms
- It validates that split-brain conditions cannot occur
- It ensures proper leader succession during network failures
- It verifies that uncommitted work is properly discarded

The implementation must ensure that clients connected to the isolated leader
receive appropriate responses (timeouts or redirects) rather than inconsistent
state updates.
