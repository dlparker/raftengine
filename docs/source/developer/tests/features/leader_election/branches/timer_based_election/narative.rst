This feature validates the system's ability to conduct elections using real-time timer mechanisms rather than simulated or manually-controlled timing, ensuring that actual timeout-based election triggers function correctly in production-like conditions.

Timer-based elections represent the production operation mode of Raft clusters, where elections are initiated by actual timeout expiration rather than manual test control. This mode tests the integration between the timer subsystem and the election logic under realistic timing conditions.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Real Timer Integration**: Elections triggered by actual timeout expiration events
- **Asynchronous Timing**: Timer events occur independently of test control flow
- **Concurrent Timer Management**: Multiple nodes running independent timers simultaneously
- **Timer Precision**: System responds appropriately to sub-second timeout events
- **Timer Cancellation**: Election timers properly cancelled when elections complete
- **Timer Reset**: Timers correctly reset after successful elections or heartbeat receipt

**Timer-Based Election Process**:
1. Cluster starts with timers enabled (timers_disabled=False)
2. Nodes begin countdown timers based on their configured timeout ranges
3. First node to experience timeout automatically becomes candidate
4. Timer expiration triggers role transition without external intervention
5. Election proceeds with normal message exchange and voting
6. Winner election causes timer reset across all participating nodes
7. New leader begins heartbeat timers to prevent future elections

**Real-Time Behaviors**:
- **Autonomous Operation**: Elections proceed without manual test intervention
- **Natural Timing**: Timeouts occur at realistic intervals based on configuration
- **Race Conditions**: Multiple nodes may timeout near-simultaneously
- **Timer Jitter**: Real timers include natural timing variations
- **Interruption Handling**: Timers properly handle election completion events
- **Resource Management**: Timer tasks created and cleaned up appropriately

**Production Scenarios**:
- **Leader Heartbeat Failure**: Real timeouts detect missing leader heartbeats
- **Network Partition Recovery**: Timers trigger elections when partitions resolve
- **Startup Elections**: Initial cluster formation using timer-driven candidate emergence
- **Multiple Timeout Events**: Handling multiple concurrent timeout events appropriately
- **Timer Coordination**: Ensuring timer events don't interfere with each other

**Testing Integration**:
- **Timing Assertions**: Validating elections occur within expected time windows
- **Concurrency Testing**: Multiple timer-driven events happening simultaneously
- **Performance Validation**: Ensuring timer overhead doesn't impact system performance
- **Resource Cleanup**: Verifying timer resources are properly managed and released
- **Error Handling**: Testing timer behavior under various error conditions

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests the critical integration point between Raft's timing subsystem and election logic, ensuring that production deployments will reliably initiate elections when leaders fail, while maintaining the correctness and performance characteristics required for distributed consensus.
