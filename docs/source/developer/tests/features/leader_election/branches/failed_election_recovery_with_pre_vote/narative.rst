Failed Election Recovery with Pre-Vote tests the system's ability to handle election failures when pre-vote is enabled and properly recover through subsequent elections.

This feature validates scenarios where a leader is elected but crashes before completing the term start process (before followers receive the initial heartbeat/term start log entry). The test ensures that:

1. **Pre-Vote Protection**: The pre-vote mechanism correctly identifies and handles election failures
2. **Log Conflict Resolution**: When a crashed leader restarts, its partial log entries are properly resolved against the new leader's log
3. **State Recovery**: Failed leaders can rejoin the cluster and synchronize with the new leader's state
4. **Election Continuation**: The cluster can conduct new elections despite previous election failures

**Key Validation Points**:
- Pre-vote responses correctly reject outdated candidates
- Log term conflicts are resolved according to Raft safety properties
- Crashed nodes can recover and accept new leadership
- Cluster maintains consistency through election failure/recovery cycles

This feature is critical for ensuring cluster resilience when elections are interrupted by leader failures during the critical transition period.
