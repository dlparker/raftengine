This feature branch validates that the pre-vote mechanism includes proper log comparison checks to prevent candidates with outdated logs from proceeding to the actual election phase.

The pre-vote optimization allows candidates to test their election viability before incrementing their term. During pre-vote, voters must perform the same log comparison checks as in regular elections, ensuring that only candidates with up-to-date logs can advance to the real election phase.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Pre-Vote Log Check**: Log comparison is performed during pre-vote requests
- **Early Filtering**: Outdated candidates are filtered out before term increment
- **Consistency**: Same log comparison rules apply to both pre-vote and regular vote
- **Efficiency**: Prevents unnecessary term increments for unelectable candidates

**Test Scenario**:
A candidate with an outdated log initiates a pre-vote phase. Voters must perform log comparison checks and reject the pre-vote request, preventing the candidate from proceeding to increment its term and start a real election.
