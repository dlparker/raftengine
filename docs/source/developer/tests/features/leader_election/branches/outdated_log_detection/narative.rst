This feature branch validates that a candidate can properly detect when its log is outdated compared to other nodes in the cluster, preventing candidates with stale logs from becoming leaders.

According to Raft safety properties, only candidates with up-to-date logs should be able to win elections. This prevents log entries from being lost and ensures that the new leader has all committed entries from previous terms.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Log Currency Check**: Candidate evaluates whether its log is up-to-date
- **Comparative Analysis**: Log is compared against other nodes' logs during election
- **Safety Enforcement**: Outdated candidates are prevented from winning elections
- **Vote Rejection**: Nodes reject votes from candidates with outdated logs

**Test Scenario**:
A candidate with an outdated log attempts to win an election. Other nodes in the cluster must detect the candidate's stale log and reject its vote requests, preventing the outdated candidate from becoming leader.
