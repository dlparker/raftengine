This feature branch validates that candidates and voters properly compare log histories to determine election eligibility, ensuring that only candidates with sufficiently up-to-date logs can become leaders.

The log comparison process involves comparing both the term and index of the last log entry. A candidate's log is considered up-to-date if the last entry's term is higher, or if the terms are equal but the index is higher or equal.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Term Comparison**: Last entry term is compared between candidate and voter logs
- **Index Comparison**: When terms are equal, log indices are compared
- **Eligibility Determination**: Voters grant votes only to candidates with up-to-date logs
- **Safety Preservation**: Prevents candidates with missing committed entries from winning

**Test Scenario**:
During an election, voters receive RequestVote messages from candidates and must compare their own log state with the candidate's log information to determine whether the candidate is eligible to receive their vote.
