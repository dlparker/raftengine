This feature validates the critical mechanism by which followers reject RequestVote messages when they have already cast their vote for the current term, ensuring strict enforcement of the single-vote-per-term constraint that underlies Raft's election safety properties.

Vote rejection serves as the primary enforcement mechanism for preventing multiple leaders in the same term, making it essential that this behavior is implemented correctly and tested thoroughly under all possible scenarios.

**Vote Rejection Mechanism**:

**Rejection Criteria**:
- Follower has already voted for any candidate in the current term
- RequestVote term matches follower's current term
- Vote rejection occurs regardless of candidate qualifications
- Rejection response includes current term information

**Response Generation**:
- Set `voteGranted: false` in RequestVoteResponse
- Include follower's current term in response
- Preserve existing `votedFor` state without modification
- Send response immediately without additional processing

**State Preservation**:
- Maintain original vote decision unchanged
- Preserve persistent vote record across rejection
- Ensure no corruption of existing vote state
- Continue normal follower operations after rejection

**Protocol Implementation Details**:

**Message Processing**:
1. Receive RequestVote message from candidate
2. Check if current term matches RequestVote term
3. Verify if `votedFor` is already set for current term
4. If already voted, immediately reject without further evaluation
5. Generate negative RequestVoteResponse with current term

**Persistence Requirements**:
- Vote rejection does not modify persistent state
- Original vote decision remains in stable storage
- No additional disk writes required for rejection processing
- Existing vote record integrity maintained throughout rejection

**Network Response**:
- Send rejection response promptly to requesting candidate
- Include accurate term information for candidate synchronization
- Ensure response delivery despite rejection decision
- Maintain normal communication patterns during rejection

**Safety Implications**:

**Election Safety Preservation**:
- Prevents multiple candidates from claiming majority support
- Ensures deterministic election outcomes within each term
- Maintains consistency of vote distribution across cluster
- Prevents byzantinian behavior in election process

**Consistency Guarantees**:
- Vote state remains consistent across all followers
- No retroactive vote changes within same term
- Deterministic behavior regardless of message timing
- Predictable election outcomes under controlled conditions

**Fault Tolerance**:
- Rejection behavior survives node restarts and failures
- Vote state consistency maintained across recovery scenarios
- Proper rejection continues after network partitions heal
- Robust behavior under various failure conditions

**Testing Validation Requirements**:

**Primary Test Scenarios**:
1. **Sequential Vote Requests**: First vote granted, subsequent votes rejected
2. **Rapid Request Handling**: Proper rejection under high-frequency requests
3. **Cross-Candidate Rejection**: Rejection of different candidates after initial vote
4. **Persistent Rejection**: Rejection behavior after node restart

**Response Validation**:
- Verify `voteGranted: false` in rejection responses
- Confirm correct term information in responses
- Validate response timing and delivery
- Ensure no spurious positive responses

**State Validation**:
- Confirm `votedFor` state unchanged after rejection
- Verify no corruption of persistent vote records
- Validate consistent rejection behavior across test runs
- Ensure proper state maintenance during extended rejection periods

**Edge Case Testing**:

**Timing Edge Cases**:
- Simultaneous RequestVote messages from different candidates
- Vote requests during term transition periods
- Rejection handling during network delays and reordering
- Proper behavior under message loss and retry scenarios

**Failure Scenarios**:
- Vote rejection during node failures and recovery
- Rejection behavior during network partitions
- Proper rejection state after crash and restart
- Consistency maintenance during various failure modes

**Performance Scenarios**:
- Rejection handling under high request rates
- Resource efficiency during extended rejection periods
- Proper cleanup and garbage collection of rejection state
- Scalability validation with large numbers of rejection requests

**Integration Testing**:

**Election Process Integration**:
- Rejection behavior during complete election cycles
- Interaction with election timeout and retry mechanisms
- Proper integration with candidate state management
- Coordination with term advancement processes

**Cluster Behavior Integration**:
- Rejection impact on overall cluster consensus
- Interaction with log replication and other Raft operations
- Proper behavior during membership changes
- Integration with snapshot transfer and recovery processes

**Protocol Compliance**:
- Validation of Raft specification compliance
- Conformance with RequestVote RPC requirements
- Proper adherence to safety and liveness properties
- Compatibility with other Raft implementations

**Error Handling and Recovery**:

**Malformed Request Handling**:
- Proper rejection of corrupted RequestVote messages
- Graceful handling of invalid candidate information
- Robust behavior with malformed message fields
- Prevention of state corruption from bad requests

**Resource Management**:
- Efficient processing of rejection requests
- Proper memory management during rejection handling
- Prevention of resource leaks during extended rejection periods
- Optimization of rejection processing overhead

**Monitoring and Diagnostics**:
- Logging and telemetry for rejection events
- Debugging support for rejection-related issues
- Performance monitoring of rejection processing
- Analysis tools for rejection pattern identification

This feature is fundamental to Raft's safety guarantees and must be implemented with extreme care and tested comprehensively to ensure that the single-vote-per-term constraint is never violated under any circumstances.
