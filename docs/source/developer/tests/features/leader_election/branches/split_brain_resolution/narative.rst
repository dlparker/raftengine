This feature branch validates the system's ability to resolve split-brain scenarios that can occur during network partitions and leader elections, ensuring only one legitimate leader exists at any given time.

A split-brain scenario occurs when network partitions isolate the current leader from followers, who then elect a new leader, resulting in two nodes believing they are the leader. The Raft consensus algorithm must detect and resolve these situations to maintain cluster consistency.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Term Advancement**: New elections use higher term numbers to supersede old leaders
- **Quorum Requirements**: Elections require majority votes to establish legitimate leadership
- **Leader Demotion**: Old leaders discover higher terms and step down to follower role
- **Log Consistency**: Conflicting log entries are resolved according to Raft rules
- **State Convergence**: All nodes eventually agree on the single legitimate leader

**Resolution Process**:
1. Network partition isolates current leader from majority of followers
2. Isolated followers start election with higher term number
3. New leader is elected among majority partition
4. New leader begins accepting commands and replicating entries
5. When partition heals, old leader discovers higher term
6. Old leader demotes itself to follower role
7. Conflicting log entries are resolved through normal Raft mechanics

**Split-Brain Detection**:
- **Term Comparison**: Messages with higher terms indicate newer leadership
- **Vote Validation**: Leaders cannot get votes from nodes with higher terms
- **Heartbeat Responses**: AppendEntries responses indicate term conflicts
- **Election Timeouts**: Isolated leaders lose ability to maintain heartbeats

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests scenarios where concurrent leadership claims must be resolved, ensuring the fundamental Raft safety property that at most one leader can exist per term.
