This feature branch validates the system's ability for a follower to detect leadership absence, promote itself to candidate status, conduct an election campaign, and successfully become the new cluster leader.

Follower promotion is the core mechanism by which Raft clusters maintain availability when the current leader fails or becomes unreachable. A follower must detect the absence of leadership through missed heartbeats, then initiate the election process to restore cluster leadership.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Leadership Detection**: Follower detects absence of current leader
- **Election Trigger**: Follower times out waiting for leader heartbeat  
- **Role Transition**: Follower transitions from FOLLOWER to CANDIDATE
- **Term Increment**: Candidate increments term number for new election
- **Vote Solicitation**: Candidate sends RequestVote messages to all peers
- **Vote Collection**: Candidate collects and evaluates vote responses
- **Majority Achievement**: Candidate wins election with majority of votes
- **Leadership Assumption**: Winner transitions from CANDIDATE to LEADER

**Follower Promotion Process**:
1. Follower operates normally, receiving heartbeats from current leader
2. Follower detects missed heartbeats indicating leader failure/absence
3. Follower waits for election timeout period to expire
4. Follower transitions role from FOLLOWER to CANDIDATE
5. Candidate increments current term number
6. Candidate votes for itself in the new term
7. Candidate sends RequestVote messages to all other cluster members
8. Candidate waits for and collects RequestVoteResponse messages
9. If majority of votes received, candidate becomes LEADER
10. New leader begins sending heartbeats to establish authority

**Promotion Properties**:
- **Timeout Driven**: Promotion triggered by election timeout mechanism
- **Term Safety**: Each promotion increments term to ensure safety
- **Majority Requirement**: Leadership requires majority consensus
- **Log Completeness**: Candidate must have sufficiently up-to-date log
- **Vote Once**: Each server votes at most once per term
- **Randomized Timeouts**: Prevents simultaneous promotions causing split votes

**Election Campaign**:
- **Self Vote**: Candidate always votes for itself first
- **Peer Solicitation**: Requests votes from all other cluster members
- **Log Comparison**: Voters compare candidate's log with their own
- **Term Verification**: Voters ensure candidate's term is current
- **Response Collection**: Candidate tallies votes to determine outcome

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests the fundamental election mechanism that ensures cluster availability by enabling followers to assume leadership when needed, maintaining the system's fault tolerance and continued operation.
