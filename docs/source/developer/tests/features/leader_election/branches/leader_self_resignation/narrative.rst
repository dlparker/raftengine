This feature branch validates that leaders automatically step down and transition to follower state when they detect they are isolated from the majority partition and cannot maintain quorum.

**Key Self-Resignation Behaviors**:

- **Automatic Demotion**: Leaders automatically step down when isolation is detected
- **State Transition**: Isolated leaders transition cleanly from leader to follower state
- **Resource Release**: Leaders release leadership resources and cease leader-specific operations
- **Recovery Readiness**: Self-resigned leaders are ready to follow a new leader when connectivity is restored

**Availability Requirements**: Leader self-resignation prevents indefinite split-brain conditions and allows the majority partition to continue operating while ensuring isolated leaders can rejoin the cluster when network connectivity is restored.
