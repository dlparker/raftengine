This feature branch validates that leaders maintain their leadership role when they have access to a majority quorum, even in the presence of minority network partitions or individual node failures.

**Key Leader Stability Behaviors**:

- **Quorum Maintenance**: Leaders continue operating when they can reach a majority of nodes
- **Resilience to Minority Failures**: Leaders remain stable despite individual node or minority partition failures
- **Continued Operation**: Leaders maintain normal operations including heartbeats and command processing
- **Appropriate Non-Resignation**: Leaders correctly avoid unnecessary step-downs when they have quorum

**Performance Requirements**: Leader stability ensures cluster availability and prevents unnecessary leadership changes that could disrupt service when the leader maintains majority connectivity.
