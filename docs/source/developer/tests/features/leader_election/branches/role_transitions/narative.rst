Role Transitions validate the correct state changes between FOLLOWER, CANDIDATE, and LEADER roles during various Raft operations.

This feature ensures that nodes transition between roles according to Raft protocol rules and that these transitions are properly tracked and monitored:

1. **Follower to Candidate**: Nodes start elections when detecting leader failure
2. **Candidate to Leader**: Successful candidates become leaders after winning elections
3. **Leader to Follower**: Leaders step down when detecting higher terms or voluntarily
4. **Candidate to Follower**: Failed candidates return to follower state
5. **Event Generation**: All transitions generate appropriate monitoring events

**Key Validation Points**:
- Role transitions follow Raft protocol rules exactly
- Transitions occur at correct times during elections and operations
- Each transition generates proper monitoring events
- Node state is correctly updated with each role change
- Multiple nodes coordinate role changes during elections
- Invalid transitions are prevented

**Transition Scenarios Tested**:
- Normal election progression: FOLLOWER → CANDIDATE → LEADER
- Election failures: CANDIDATE → FOLLOWER
- Voluntary step down: LEADER → FOLLOWER
- Term updates forcing role changes
- Multiple simultaneous role changes during elections

This feature is fundamental to Raft correctness, ensuring that the cluster maintains exactly one leader at any time and that all role changes follow the protocol specifications.
