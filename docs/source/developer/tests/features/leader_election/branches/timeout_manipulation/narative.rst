This feature validates the system's ability to manipulate election timeout ranges on individual nodes to achieve predictable election outcomes and controlled timing behaviors during leader selection processes.

Election timeout manipulation is a testing technique that allows precise control over which node initiates elections by setting dramatically different timeout ranges for different nodes. This enables deterministic testing of election scenarios that would otherwise be probabilistic due to timeout randomization.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Per-Node Timeout Configuration**: Individual nodes can have distinct timeout ranges
- **Extreme Timeout Differences**: Nodes can be configured with vastly different timeout ranges (e.g., 0.01-0.011s vs 0.9-1.0s)
- **Configuration Persistence**: Timeout changes persist throughout test execution
- **Predictable Election Timing**: Nodes with shorter timeouts reliably trigger elections first
- **Range Validation**: System properly validates and enforces configured timeout ranges
- **Runtime Reconfiguration**: Timeout ranges can be modified during cluster operation

**Timeout Manipulation Process**:
1. Cluster starts with default timeout configuration
2. Individual nodes receive new timeout range configurations
3. Nodes with extremely short timeouts (0.01-0.011s) become likely election initiators
4. Nodes with extremely long timeouts (0.9-1.0s) become unlikely to initiate elections
5. The dramatic difference ensures predictable election initiation ordering
6. Test can verify specific nodes trigger elections as expected

**Manipulation Strategies**:
- **Election Winner Control**: Short timeouts ensure specific nodes win elections
- **Election Loser Control**: Long timeouts prevent specific nodes from starting elections  
- **Timing Determinism**: Removes randomness from election timing for testing
- **Scenario Isolation**: Allows testing specific election scenarios reliably
- **Failure Simulation**: Enables controlled testing of various failure scenarios

**Configuration Scenarios**:
- **Unequal Timeout Ranges**: Different nodes with non-overlapping timeout ranges
- **Guaranteed Winners**: Nodes with timeouts orders of magnitude shorter than others
- **Election Suppression**: Nodes with timeouts so long they never timeout in test duration
- **Dynamic Reconfiguration**: Changing timeout ranges mid-test to alter election behavior
- **Extreme Range Testing**: Validating system behavior with unusually short or long timeouts

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests the system's flexibility in timeout configuration and validates that timeout manipulation can be used as an effective testing strategy for creating deterministic election scenarios while maintaining the correctness of the underlying Raft election mechanisms.
