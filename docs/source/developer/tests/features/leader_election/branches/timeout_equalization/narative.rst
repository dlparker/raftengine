This feature validates the system's ability to normalize election timeout ranges across all cluster nodes, creating fair competition conditions where any node has an equal opportunity to initiate elections based purely on randomization rather than configuration bias.

Timeout equalization reverses the effects of timeout manipulation by setting all nodes to identical timeout ranges, restoring normal probabilistic election behavior where leadership emergence depends on random timeout selection rather than predetermined configuration advantages.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Uniform Configuration**: All nodes receive identical timeout range settings
- **Fair Competition**: No node has timeout advantage over others after equalization
- **Configuration Persistence**: Equalized settings persist throughout subsequent operations
- **Random Election Behavior**: Elections return to normal randomized timing patterns
- **Equal Opportunity**: Any node can potentially win elections after equalization
- **State Consistency**: Timeout changes don't affect node state or term values

**Timeout Equalization Process**:
1. Cluster operates with potentially manipulated timeout configurations
2. All nodes receive identical timeout range configuration (e.g., 0.01-0.011s for all)
3. Previous timeout advantages or disadvantages are eliminated
4. Subsequent elections rely purely on random timeout selection within common range
5. Election outcomes become probabilistic rather than predetermined
6. Test validates that all nodes have equal timeout ranges after equalization

**Equalization Scenarios**:
- **Post-Manipulation Recovery**: Returning to fair timing after controlled elections
- **Mid-Test Normalization**: Switching from controlled to natural election behavior
- **Performance Testing**: Measuring election behavior under normal timing conditions
- **Randomization Validation**: Ensuring random timeout selection works correctly
- **Fairness Verification**: Confirming no node has persistent timing advantages

**Configuration Management**:
- **Batch Updates**: Updating all nodes simultaneously to identical settings
- **Range Validation**: Ensuring all nodes report identical timeout ranges
- **Timing Synchronization**: Coordinating timeout changes across the cluster
- **State Preservation**: Maintaining cluster state while changing timeout configuration
- **Effect Verification**: Confirming equalization achieved desired timing behavior

**Testing Applications**:
- **Natural Election Testing**: Testing elections under normal randomized conditions
- **Performance Baseline**: Establishing baseline performance with fair timing
- **Randomization Quality**: Validating that random timeout selection works properly
- **Long-term Behavior**: Testing sustained operation with equalized timeouts
- **Election Distribution**: Verifying elections are distributed fairly among nodes

**Before and After Validation**:
- **Pre-Equalization State**: Document timeout ranges before equalization
- **Post-Equalization State**: Verify all nodes have identical timeout ranges
- **Behavior Comparison**: Compare election patterns before and after equalization
- **Timing Analysis**: Analyze election timing distribution with equalized settings
- **Performance Impact**: Measure any performance effects of timeout changes

**Integration Patterns**:
- **Following Controlled Elections**: Used after timeout manipulation to restore fairness
- **Preparation for Natural Tests**: Setting up fair conditions for subsequent testing
- **Multi-Phase Testing**: Transitioning between controlled and natural test phases
- **Recovery Scenarios**: Restoring normal operation after specialized testing
- **Baseline Establishment**: Creating consistent starting conditions for test suites

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests the system's flexibility in timeout configuration management and validates that timeout ranges can be modified dynamically to achieve desired testing conditions, while ensuring that the underlying election mechanisms continue to function correctly regardless of configuration changes.
