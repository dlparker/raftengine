This feature branch validates the system's ability to conduct subsequent elections after initial leadership establishment, demonstrating the cluster's capacity for multiple leadership transitions with proper coordination and state management.

Re-election processes are critical for cluster resilience, enabling leadership transitions due to leader failure, planned maintenance, or administrative actions. The ability to conduct multiple successive elections demonstrates the robustness of the election protocol and the cluster's capacity for continuous operation despite leadership changes.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Sequential Elections**: Multiple election cycles within the same cluster session
- **Leadership Transition**: Clean handover from previous leader to new leader
- **State Continuity**: Preservation of log and commit state across leadership changes
- **Trigger Coordination**: Coordinated completion detection across all cluster members
- **Term Advancement**: Proper term incrementation for subsequent elections
- **Authority Transfer**: Complete authority transfer from old leader to new leader

**Re-Election Process**:
1. Previous leader demotes or becomes unavailable
2. Cluster detects leadership vacancy through missed heartbeats or explicit demotion
3. New candidate emerges and initiates campaign with higher term
4. Vote collection proceeds with updated term and state information
5. New leader establishes authority and begins replication
6. All nodes synchronize to new leader and update their state
7. Coordinated completion through trigger mechanisms ensures all nodes ready

**Re-Election Properties**:
- **State Preservation**: Log entries and commit indices maintained across transitions
- **Authority Continuity**: No gap in cluster leadership capabilities
- **Coordination Mechanisms**: WhenElectionDone triggers ensure synchronized completion
- **Term Consistency**: Proper term advancement maintains election safety
- **Log Integrity**: No loss or corruption of committed entries during transition
- **Performance Recovery**: Quick return to normal operation post-election

**Trigger Coordination**:
- **Synchronized Completion**: All nodes use WhenElectionDone triggers for coordination
- **Distributed Waiting**: Nodes wait for cluster-wide election completion
- **State Verification**: Triggers verify proper post-election state before completion
- **Timeout Handling**: Coordination includes timeout mechanisms for failure scenarios
- **Clean Completion**: All nodes reach consistent post-election state simultaneously

**Testing Validation**:
- **Multiple Transitions**: Tests successive leadership changes
- **State Consistency**: Validates log and commit state across elections
- **Performance Impact**: Measures impact of repeated elections on cluster performance
- **Coordination Effectiveness**: Tests trigger-based coordination mechanisms

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests the critical capability for sustained cluster operation through multiple leadership transitions, ensuring the election protocol remains robust and efficient across repeated use while maintaining state consistency and coordination.
