This feature branch validates that leaders properly check for quorum connectivity and make appropriate decisions about their leadership status based on their ability to communicate with a majority of cluster nodes.

**Key Quorum Checking Behaviors**:

- **Connectivity Assessment**: Leaders periodically verify they can reach a majority of cluster nodes
- **Isolation Detection**: Leaders detect when they are isolated from the majority partition
- **Decision Making**: Leaders determine whether to continue operating or step down based on quorum status
- **Heartbeat Verification**: Quorum checking integrates with heartbeat mechanisms to assess cluster connectivity

**Safety Requirements**: Proper quorum checking ensures that leaders cannot make unilateral decisions when isolated from the majority, preventing split-brain scenarios and maintaining cluster consistency.
