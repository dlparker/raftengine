This feature branch validates the system's ability to execute complete election processes automatically, from initial campaign through leader establishment and commit confirmation, without manual intervention in the election mechanics.

Automated election processes represent the highest level of election control, where the entire workflow from campaign initiation through final commit verification occurs automatically. This capability is essential for production systems where manual intervention during elections is not feasible and for testing scenarios that require complete election cycles.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **End-to-End Automation**: Complete election process from start to commit confirmation
- **Campaign Initiation**: Automatic triggering of election campaigns
- **Vote Collection**: Automated vote request and response handling
- **Leader Establishment**: Automatic leader determination and role transitions
- **Log Synchronization**: Automated log replication and term establishment
- **Commit Confirmation**: Automatic verification of commit propagation post-election

**Automated Election Workflow**:
1. Election trigger initiates campaign process automatically
2. Candidate sends RequestVote RPCs to all cluster members automatically
3. Followers respond with votes based on election rules automatically
4. Vote counting and leader determination occurs automatically
5. New leader begins sending AppendEntries and establishes authority automatically
6. Log synchronization and commit confirmation proceed automatically
7. All nodes recognize new leader and update their state automatically

**Automation Properties**:
- **Zero Manual Intervention**: No human interaction required during election
- **Deterministic Execution**: Predictable election outcomes based on cluster state
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic handling of network issues and timeout scenarios
- **State Consistency**: Guaranteed consistent cluster state post-election
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient execution without manual delays
- **Scalability**: Works across different cluster sizes automatically

**Process Completion**:
- **Authority Establishment**: New leader fully operational and accepting commands
- **Follower Synchronization**: All followers recognize and follow new leader
- **Log Consistency**: All nodes have consistent log state post-election
- **Heartbeat Establishment**: Regular heartbeat pattern established
- **Commit Propagation**: Previous committed entries properly propagated

**Testing Integration**:
- **Sequence Integration**: Works with sequence control systems for testing
- **Trigger Coordination**: Integrates with trigger systems for precise timing
- **State Validation**: Automatic validation of expected post-election state
- **Performance Measurement**: Enables measurement of election completion time

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests the critical capability for complete election automation, ensuring the system can handle leader changes without manual intervention while maintaining consistency and performance requirements.
