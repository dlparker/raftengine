This feature validates the system's ability to simulate leader loss conditions through programmatic triggers, enabling controlled testing of follower response to perceived leader failures without relying on actual network failures or timing events.

Leader lost simulation provides a testing mechanism to trigger the follower's leader failure detection logic directly, simulating the condition where a follower believes the leader has failed due to missing heartbeats. This enables deterministic testing of election initiation scenarios.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Programmatic Trigger**: do_leader_lost() method triggers leader failure detection
- **Follower Response**: Followers correctly respond to simulated leader loss events
- **Election Initiation**: Simulated leader loss properly initiates election process
- **Term Increment**: Leader loss simulation causes appropriate term advancement
- **Role Transition**: Followers transition to candidate role after leader loss detection
- **Timing Independence**: Leader loss can be triggered regardless of actual timeout status

**Leader Lost Simulation Process**:
1. Cluster operates with established leader and followers
2. Leader is programmatically demoted to follower role (do_demote_and_handle)
3. Specific follower receives do_leader_lost() signal
4. Follower interprets signal as leader failure condition
5. Follower increments term and transitions to candidate role
6. Election process begins with follower as candidate
7. Other nodes respond to election messages appropriately

**Simulation Mechanisms**:
- **Direct API Call**: do_leader_lost() provides immediate leader loss simulation
- **Controlled Timing**: Simulation occurs at precise test-controlled moments
- **Selective Triggering**: Only specific nodes receive leader loss signals
- **State Consistency**: Simulation maintains correct Raft state transitions
- **Message Flow**: Simulated leader loss triggers normal election message exchange
- **Recovery Testing**: Enables testing of various recovery scenarios

**Testing Scenarios**:
- **Single Node Election**: One follower detects leader loss and initiates election
- **Immediate Response**: Testing rapid response to leader failure conditions
- **Term Validation**: Ensuring term increments occur correctly during simulation
- **Role Verification**: Confirming proper role transitions during simulated failures
- **Election Completion**: Validating elections complete successfully after simulation
- **State Machine Consistency**: Ensuring state machines remain consistent

**Simulation vs Real Failure**:
- **Deterministic Timing**: Simulation occurs at precise moments vs random timeout events
- **Selective Impact**: Only targeted nodes experience "failure" vs network-wide effects
- **Controlled Recovery**: Test controls when and how recovery occurs
- **Repeatable Results**: Same simulation produces consistent behavior
- **Resource Efficiency**: No actual network disruption or timing delays required

**Integration with Other Features**:
- **Timeout Equalization**: Often used after leader lost simulation to normalize timing
- **Timer-Based Elections**: Simulated leader loss can trigger timer-based election sequences
- **Controlled Victory**: Combined with timeout manipulation for predetermined outcomes
- **Re-election Testing**: Used to initiate subsequent elections in test sequences

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests the follower's leader failure detection logic and ensures that the election initiation mechanism responds correctly to programmatic triggers, validating that the same code paths used for timeout-based leader failure detection work correctly when triggered through test interfaces.
