This feature branch validates the system's ability to detect split vote scenarios where no candidate receives a majority, then properly resolve them by advancing terms and conducting new elections with randomized timeouts to ensure eventual leader selection.

Split votes occur when multiple candidates simultaneously start elections, dividing the available votes so that no candidate achieves the required majority. Raft must detect this situation and recover by starting new elections with incremented term numbers and randomized timeouts.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Split Vote Detection**: Candidates recognize when insufficient votes are received
- **Term Advancement**: Failed elections trigger term number incrementation
- **Timeout Randomization**: New election attempts use randomized timeouts
- **Vote Reset**: New term resets all vote commitments from previous term
- **Candidate Persistence**: Candidates may retry or defer to successful candidates
- **Election Convergence**: Process eventually converges to single leader selection

**Split Vote Resolution Process**:
1. Multiple candidates start elections simultaneously in same term
2. Candidates send RequestVote messages to all cluster members
3. Voters can only vote for one candidate per term (first-come basis)
4. No candidate receives majority votes due to vote splitting
5. Candidates detect insufficient votes for majority
6. Failed candidates wait for randomized election timeout
7. New election begins with incremented term number
8. Random timeouts stagger candidate emergence in new term
9. Process repeats until one candidate achieves majority

**Split Vote Scenarios**:
- **Simultaneous Candidates**: Multiple nodes become candidates at same time
- **Network Timing**: Message delivery order affects vote distribution
- **Cluster Size**: Odd-numbered clusters reduce but don't eliminate split votes
- **Term Synchronization**: All nodes must advance to new term for retry
- **Timeout Staggering**: Random delays prevent repeated simultaneous elections

**Resolution Mechanisms**:
- **Term Increment**: Each failed election advances term number
- **Vote Clearing**: New term invalidates all votes from previous term
- **Random Backoff**: Candidates wait random intervals before retry
- **Eventual Success**: Randomization ensures eventual single-candidate emergence
- **State Convergence**: All nodes eventually agree on new term and leader

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests Raft's critical ability to recover from election conflicts, ensuring the cluster can select a leader even when initial election attempts fail due to vote splitting, maintaining availability and consensus safety.
