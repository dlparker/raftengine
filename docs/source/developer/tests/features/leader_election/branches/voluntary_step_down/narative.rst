Voluntary Step Down validates the leader's ability to gracefully relinquish leadership and transition back to follower state.

This feature tests the controlled leadership abdication process where a current leader voluntarily steps down from its role without being forced by timeouts, network partitions, or other failure scenarios:

1. **Command Rejection**: Leader stops accepting new client commands during step down process
2. **State Transition**: Leader cleanly transitions from LEADER to FOLLOWER role
3. **Leadership Release**: Leader releases its leadership claim and clears leader state
4. **Election Facilitation**: Former leader allows and participates in new elections
5. **Follower Behavior**: Stepped-down leader behaves correctly as a follower

**Key Validation Points**:
- Leader properly rejects commands after initiating step down
- State transition from LEADER to FOLLOWER occurs cleanly
- Former leader does not interfere with subsequent elections
- Node can participate as a normal follower after stepping down
- Cluster can establish new leadership after voluntary step down

This feature ensures graceful leadership transitions for administrative operations, load balancing, and maintenance scenarios where controlled leadership changes are required.
