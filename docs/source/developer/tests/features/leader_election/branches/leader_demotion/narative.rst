This feature branch validates the system's ability for a current leader to voluntarily step down and return to follower state, facilitating controlled leadership transitions and graceful cluster management.

Leader demotion is a critical capability that allows for planned leadership changes, maintenance operations, and graceful handling of administrative commands. When a leader demotes itself, it must properly transition state and relinquish leadership authority while maintaining cluster consistency.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Voluntary Step Down**: Leader can initiate its own demotion to follower
- **State Transition**: Leader properly transitions from LEADER to FOLLOWER role
- **Authority Relinquishment**: Leader stops sending heartbeats and processing commands
- **Term Handling**: Leader maintains current term while transitioning to follower
- **Cluster Notification**: Other nodes recognize leadership vacancy
- **Graceful Transition**: Demotion occurs without corrupting cluster state

**Leader Demotion Process**:
1. Leader receives demotion trigger (administrative or programmatic)
2. Leader stops accepting new client commands 
3. Leader transitions role state from LEADER to FOLLOWER
4. Leader stops sending heartbeats to other cluster members
5. Leader resets internal leadership state (next indices, match indices)
6. Leader begins following behavior (accepting AppendEntries from new leader)
7. Cluster detects leadership vacancy through missed heartbeats
8. Election process begins to select new leader

**Demotion Properties**:
- **State Consistency**: Log and committed entries remain intact during transition
- **Authority Transfer**: Leadership authority cleanly transfers to successor
- **Role Transition**: Clean state machine transition from leader to follower
- **Timeout Handling**: Proper reset of leader-specific timers and state
- **Recovery Capability**: Demoted leader can participate in future elections

**Post-Demotion Behavior**:
- **Follower Mode**: Ex-leader operates as normal follower
- **Election Participation**: Can vote in subsequent leader elections  
- **Log Acceptance**: Accepts AppendEntries from new leader
- **Future Leadership**: Eligible to become leader again if elected

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests the critical ability for leaders to voluntarily relinquish power, enabling controlled cluster management, planned maintenance, and administrative operations without cluster disruption.
