This feature branch validates the test infrastructure's ability to control and coordinate election processes through predefined sequences that automate the complete election workflow from initiation to completion.

Sequence-controlled elections provide a powerful testing mechanism that abstracts the complex coordination required during leader election processes. By using predefined sequences like SNormalElection, the test infrastructure can automatically manage the election workflow, including vote coordination, result determination, and post-election state validation.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Sequence Automation**: Elections can be controlled through predefined sequence objects
- **Workflow Coordination**: Complete election process from start to finish under sequence control
- **Result Determination**: Automatic determination of election outcome based on cluster configuration
- **State Synchronization**: All nodes reach consistent post-election state
- **Trigger Coordination**: Integration with trigger systems for precise timing control
- **Deterministic Execution**: Repeatable election processes for testing purposes

**Sequence Control Process**:
1. Test defines election sequence parameters (timeout, expected participants)
2. Sequence object sets up triggers on all participating nodes (WhenElectionDone)
3. Campaign initiation triggers sequence execution
4. Sequence coordinates all nodes until election completion criteria met
5. All nodes reach consistent post-election state with identified leader
6. Sequence completes when all nodes satisfy completion triggers

**Sequence Control Properties**:
- **Automated Coordination**: Eliminates manual step-by-step election control
- **Completion Detection**: Built-in mechanisms to detect election completion
- **Error Handling**: Handles timeout and failure scenarios during automation
- **State Validation**: Ensures all nodes reach expected post-election state
- **Repeatable Testing**: Enables consistent test execution across multiple runs
- **Timing Control**: Precise control over election timing and coordination

**Testing Benefits**:
- **Reduced Complexity**: Simplifies complex election test scenarios
- **Higher Level Abstraction**: Tests can focus on outcomes rather than step-by-step mechanics
- **Consistent Results**: Deterministic election processes for reliable testing
- **Integration Testing**: Tests complete workflows rather than individual components

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests the critical test infrastructure capability to automate complex distributed coordination processes, enabling higher-level testing of election outcomes and cluster behavior without manual coordination complexity.
