This feature branch validates the system's ability to conduct election campaigns under administrative control, enabling deterministic election scenarios for testing and planned leadership transitions in production environments.

Authorized campaigns provide a mechanism for controlled election initiation, allowing administrators or test systems to trigger specific nodes to begin leadership campaigns. This capability is essential for testing scenarios, planned maintenance operations, and situations where deterministic election outcomes are required.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Administrative Control**: Campaigns can be initiated through explicit authorization
- **Deterministic Elections**: Specific nodes can be designated to start campaigns
- **Testing Support**: Enables controlled election scenarios for validation
- **Planned Transitions**: Supports scheduled leadership changes
- **Authorization Mechanisms**: Proper handling of authorized vs. spontaneous campaigns
- **Election Integrity**: Authorization does not compromise election safety properties

**Authorized Campaign Process**:
1. Administrator or test system identifies target node for leadership
2. Authorization is granted through start_campaign(authorized=True) call
3. Authorized node begins election campaign with proper term increment
4. Campaign proceeds through standard RequestVote protocol
5. Other nodes respond to votes based on normal election rules
6. Election completes with authorized node as likely winner (if eligible)
7. Standard post-election procedures establish new leadership

**Authorization Properties**:
- **Explicit Control**: Clear distinction between authorized and timeout-driven campaigns
- **Safety Preservation**: Authorization does not bypass election safety rules
- **Vote Validation**: Followers still apply standard voting criteria
- **Term Management**: Proper term handling for authorized campaigns
- **Timing Control**: Administrative control over campaign timing
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles conflicts between multiple authorized campaigns

**Testing Benefits**:
- **Deterministic Scenarios**: Enables predictable election outcomes for testing
- **Specific Node Testing**: Tests specific nodes as leaders in controlled manner
- **Scenario Reproduction**: Enables reproduction of specific election patterns
- **State Validation**: Allows testing of election mechanics with known outcomes
- **Performance Measurement**: Enables measurement of election performance under controlled conditions

**Production Use Cases**:
- **Planned Maintenance**: Controlled leadership transfer before maintenance
- **Load Balancing**: Administrative rebalancing of leadership responsibilities
- **Performance Optimization**: Moving leadership to optimal nodes
- **Disaster Recovery**: Controlled recovery procedures with specific leader selection

**Authorization Mechanisms**:
- **API Control**: Programmatic authorization through API calls
- **Administrative Commands**: Command-line or UI-based authorization
- **Scripted Operations**: Integration with operational scripts and procedures
- **Testing Frameworks**: Integration with automated testing systems

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests the critical capability for administrative control over election processes, ensuring that controlled leadership transitions can be executed reliably while preserving all safety and consistency properties of the Raft protocol.
