This feature branch validates the system's ability to initiate elections based on randomized timeout mechanisms, ensuring robust leader selection even in complex timing scenarios and preventing perpetual split votes through randomization.

Timeout-driven elections are the primary mechanism by which Raft clusters detect leader failures and initiate new leadership selection. The randomization of election timeouts is crucial for preventing all nodes from starting elections simultaneously, which would lead to split votes and election failures.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Timeout Detection**: Nodes detect leader absence through missed heartbeat timeouts
- **Random Timeout Values**: Election timeouts are randomized within configured ranges
- **Staggered Elections**: Different timeout values prevent simultaneous candidate emergence
- **Timeout Configuration**: System respects configured minimum and maximum timeout bounds
- **Election Initiation**: Timeout expiration triggers proper candidate role transition
- **Timer Management**: Timeouts are properly reset and managed throughout election cycles

**Timeout-Driven Election Process**:
1. Follower begins in normal operation, receiving regular leader heartbeats
2. Leader fails or becomes unreachable, heartbeats stop arriving
3. Follower's election timeout begins counting down from random value
4. If timeout expires without heartbeat, follower becomes candidate
5. Candidate increments term and begins election campaign
6. Other followers with longer timeouts remain followers initially
7. If election fails (split vote), candidates wait random timeout before retry
8. Process repeats until a leader is successfully elected

**Timeout Randomization Properties**:
- **Range Configuration**: Timeouts selected from configurable min/max range
- **Collision Prevention**: Random values reduce simultaneous candidate emergence
- **Network Jitter**: Randomization accounts for network timing variations
- **Split Vote Recovery**: Failed elections trigger new randomized timeouts
- **Leader Stability**: Randomization helps ensure single leader emergence

**Election Timing Scenarios**:
- **Normal Operation**: Heartbeats prevent timeout expiration
- **Leader Failure**: Multiple nodes experience timeout, staggered by randomization
- **Network Partition**: Isolated nodes timeout and attempt election
- **Split Vote**: Failed candidates wait random intervals before retry
- **Timing Precision**: System handles precise timeout scheduling and expiration

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests the fundamental timing mechanism that drives Raft's fault tolerance, ensuring elections can be initiated reliably through timeout-based detection while randomization prevents election conflicts and ensures eventual leader selection.
