Partial Election Processing handles elections that occur when some cluster members are unavailable or have crashed.

This feature validates election behavior when the full cluster is not participating, ensuring that available nodes can still establish leadership when they maintain a majority:

1. **Reduced Participation**: Elections proceed with subset of cluster members
2. **Majority Consensus**: Leadership established when majority of available nodes agree
3. **Crashed Node Handling**: Elections succeed despite some nodes being offline
4. **Timer-Driven Process**: Automatic election triggering through timeout mechanisms
5. **Quorum Validation**: Ensure only valid majorities can establish leadership

**Key Validation Points**:
- Elections succeed when majority of nodes are available
- Crashed or offline nodes do not prevent valid elections
- Timer mechanisms correctly trigger elections after leader failure
- New leaders are established with proper authority
- Minority partitions cannot establish invalid leadership
- Election process adapts to varying cluster sizes

**Partial Election Scenarios**:
- Leader crashes with remaining nodes available
- Network partitions creating majority and minority groups
- Rolling node failures during ongoing operations
- Recovery scenarios with subset of cluster operational

This feature is essential for cluster availability, ensuring that temporary node failures or network issues do not unnecessarily block cluster operations when a majority of nodes remain functional.
