Power Transfer Timeout validates the leader's ability to recover from failed power transfer attempts and resume normal operations when transfer cannot complete within the timeout period.

This feature tests the robustness of the power transfer mechanism when network issues, node failures, or other problems prevent successful completion of the transfer process:

1. **Timeout Detection**: Leader detects when power transfer cannot complete within election timeout
2. **Transfer Abortion**: Leader cleanly aborts the failed transfer process
3. **Command Acceptance Resume**: Leader resumes accepting client commands after failed transfer
4. **Normal Operations**: Leader returns to normal operational state
5. **Network Recovery**: System handles network blocking and subsequent recovery

**Key Validation Points**:
- Power transfer properly times out when target node is unreachable
- Leader correctly aborts failed transfer attempts
- Command acceptance is properly restored after transfer failure
- Retry logic correctly identifies failed attempts and allows retry
- Network blocking does not permanently disrupt leader functionality
- System maintains availability despite power transfer failures

**Failure Scenarios Tested**:
- Network blocking prevents target node communication
- Target node crashes during transfer process
- Transfer timeout expires before completion
- Leader recovery from blocked transfer state

This feature ensures that power transfer failures do not compromise cluster availability and that leaders can gracefully recover from transfer problems to continue serving client requests.
