System reliability features validate that the Raft implementation properly handles various failure scenarios and recovers correctly to maintain cluster availability and data consistency.

These features test the system's resilience to node crashes, network failures, and other fault conditions. They ensure that the Raft cluster can continue operating correctly even when individual nodes fail, and that failed nodes can successfully rejoin the cluster after recovery.

**Key Areas Covered**:

- **Crash Recovery**: Nodes properly restore state after crashes and rejoin clusters
- **Leader Failure During Elections**: Elections continue despite leader crashes
- **State Consistency**: System maintains consistency across failure and recovery cycles
- **Availability Preservation**: Cluster remains available despite individual node failures

**Testing Approach**:
Tests simulate various failure scenarios including node crashes at critical moments, network partitions during state transitions, and recovery sequences. Each test validates that the system maintains safety properties while maximizing availability.
