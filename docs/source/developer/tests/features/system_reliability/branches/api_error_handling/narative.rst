API Error Handling validates that the Raft system properly detects, reports, and handles various error conditions through its public APIs.

This feature ensures that the system provides robust error handling and validation for client interactions, preventing invalid operations and providing clear feedback when operations cannot be completed:

1. **Permission Validation**: Ensures only authorized nodes can perform restricted operations
2. **Parameter Validation**: Validates input parameters and rejects invalid values
3. **State Verification**: Checks that operations are valid in the current system state
4. **Error Reporting**: Provides clear error messages for invalid operations
5. **System Protection**: Prevents invalid operations from corrupting system state

**Key Validation Points**:
- Non-leader nodes cannot initiate power transfers
- Invalid node URIs are rejected with appropriate errors
- Operations fail gracefully with meaningful error messages
- System state remains consistent after error conditions
- Error handling does not disrupt normal cluster operations

**Error Scenarios Tested**:
- Power transfer attempts by follower nodes
- Operations with malformed or invalid node identifiers
- State-dependent operations in incorrect states
- Resource access violations and permission errors

This feature is critical for building reliable applications on top of the Raft consensus system, ensuring that client errors are handled gracefully without affecting cluster stability.
