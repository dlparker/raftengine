This feature branch validates that the cluster can properly handle scenarios where the current leader crashes while an election is already in progress, ensuring that election processes complete successfully despite leader failures.

When a leader crashes during an ongoing election, the cluster must continue the election process without interference from the failed leader. This includes handling any partial state changes the leader may have made before crashing and ensuring the election completes with a valid outcome.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Election Continuation**: Ongoing elections proceed despite leader crash
- **State Cleanup**: Any partial state from crashed leader is handled properly
- **No Interference**: Crashed leader doesn't disrupt election outcome
- **Successful Completion**: Election completes with valid leader selection

**Test Scenario**:
An election is in progress when the current leader crashes. The cluster must detect the leader failure and continue the election process, ultimately selecting a new leader without being disrupted by the crash or any partial state changes from the failed leader.
