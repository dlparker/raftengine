This feature branch validates that message processing maintains FIFO ordering even under concurrent conditions. The message serialization system ensures that messages are processed in the order they are received, preventing race conditions and maintaining system consistency.

**Key Serialization Behaviors**:

- **FIFO Ordering**: Messages are processed in the exact order they arrive at a node
- **Concurrent Protection**: Multiple simultaneous message arrivals are properly queued and processed sequentially
- **Completion Guarantee**: A message must complete processing before the next message begins
- **Timeout Handling**: The serialization system includes timeout mechanisms to prevent deadlocks

**Reliability Requirements**: Message serialization is critical for maintaining the deterministic behavior required by the Raft consensus algorithm, ensuring that all nodes process events in a consistent and predictable manner.
