This feature branch validates that nodes can properly recover their state and resume participation in the cluster after experiencing a crash and subsequent restart.

When a node crashes and restarts, it must recover its persistent state (current term, voted for, log entries) and rejoin the cluster without compromising safety or causing inconsistencies. The recovery process must handle various scenarios including recovery during elections, log replication, and normal operations.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **State Recovery**: Persistent state is correctly restored from storage
- **Cluster Rejoining**: Node successfully rejoins the cluster after restart
- **Consistency Preservation**: Recovery doesn't introduce state inconsistencies
- **Operation Resumption**: Node resumes normal participation in cluster operations

**Test Scenario**:
A node crashes during various cluster operations (elections, log replication, etc.) and then restarts. The node must recover its state from persistent storage and successfully rejoin the cluster without disrupting ongoing operations or compromising data consistency.
