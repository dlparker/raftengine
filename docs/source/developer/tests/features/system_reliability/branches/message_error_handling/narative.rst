Message Error Handling ensures the Raft system gracefully handles various message processing failures and corruption scenarios without compromising cluster stability.

This feature validates the robustness of message processing infrastructure against unexpected errors, malformed messages, and corruption scenarios that could occur in real-world distributed environments:

1. **Message Explosion Handling**: System handles exceptions during message processing
2. **Message Corruption Recovery**: Graceful handling of corrupted or malformed messages
3. **Error Event Generation**: Proper error events are generated for monitoring
4. **Problem History Tracking**: System maintains history of message processing issues
5. **Continued Operation**: Cluster continues functioning despite individual message failures

**Key Validation Points**:
- Message processing exceptions are caught and handled gracefully
- Corrupted messages are detected and rejected without system crash
- Error events are properly generated and can be monitored
- Problem history is maintained for debugging purposes
- Individual message failures do not disrupt overall cluster operation
- System maintains safety properties despite message corruption

**Error Scenarios Tested**:
- Intentional exceptions during message decode/processing
- Message corruption with invalid data injection
- Malformed message structures and invalid message codes
- Network-level corruption and data integrity issues

This feature is critical for production Raft deployments where network issues, hardware problems, or software bugs could introduce various forms of message corruption or processing failures.
