This feature branch validates the system's ability to detect and handle corrupted messages gracefully. Message corruption can occur due to network issues, hardware failures, or memory corruption, and the system must be resilient to such failures.

**Key Corruption Handling Behaviors**:

- **Detection Mechanisms**: The system detects corrupted messages during deserialization or processing
- **Graceful Degradation**: Corrupted messages are logged and discarded without causing system crashes
- **Error Reporting**: Corruption events are properly recorded in error history for debugging and monitoring
- **Recovery Operations**: The system continues normal operation after encountering corrupted messages

**Resilience Requirements**: Message corruption handling is essential for maintaining system stability in real-world deployments where network and hardware failures can cause data corruption.
