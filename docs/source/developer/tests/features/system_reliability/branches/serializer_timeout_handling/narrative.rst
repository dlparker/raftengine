This feature branch validates that the message serialization system properly handles timeout conditions when message processing takes longer than expected. Timeouts prevent the system from becoming deadlocked when messages cannot be processed.

**Key Timeout Handling Behaviors**:

- **Timeout Detection**: The serializer detects when message processing exceeds configured timeout limits
- **Resource Release**: Timed-out messages are properly cleaned up and resources are released
- **Error Logging**: Timeout events are recorded for monitoring and debugging purposes
- **System Recovery**: The serializer continues normal operation after timeout events

**Availability Requirements**: Proper timeout handling ensures that the system remains responsive and available even when individual messages encounter processing delays or failures.
