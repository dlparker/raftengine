This feature branch validates the system's ability to handle and recover from state machine execution errors at the leader node that don't crash the node entirely.

Unlike follower errors which can be tolerated as long as a quorum succeeds, leader errors have more significant implications since the leader is responsible for determining when entries are committed. When a leader encounters a state machine error, the command cannot be committed until the error condition is resolved.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Error Detection**: Leader properly detects and reports state machine execution failures
- **Command Rejection**: Failed commands are not committed to the cluster log
- **Client Notification**: Error responses are sent back to requesting clients
- **Recovery Mechanism**: Leader can retry commands after error conditions are cleared
- **Consistency Preservation**: Failed commands don't affect cluster state or safety properties

**Error Recovery Process**:
1. Leader attempts to execute state machine command
2. State machine execution encounters an error (non-fatal)
3. Leader reports error to client, does not commit log entry
4. External intervention resolves the error condition  
5. Client can retry the command or leader can retry automatically
6. Once error is cleared, command executes successfully and is committed

This ensures that transient issues (resource constraints, temporary conflicts, etc.) at the leader don't permanently block command processing while maintaining strong consistency guarantees.
