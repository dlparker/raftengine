This feature branch validates the system's ability to handle and recover from state machine execution errors at follower nodes that don't crash the node entirely.

While the Raft paper doesn't explicitly address this scenario, practical implementations must handle cases where state machine command execution encounters recoverable errors. This feature tests that the cluster can continue operating when a follower experiences a temporary failure applying a command, and that the follower can retry and successfully apply the command when the error condition is resolved.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Partial Success Tolerance**: Cluster continues operation when individual followers fail
- **Error Retry Mechanism**: Failed followers retry command execution on subsequent heartbeats
- **Consistency Recovery**: Followers eventually achieve consistency after error resolution
- **Quorum Maintenance**: System maintains availability as long as quorum nodes succeed

**Error Recovery Process**:
1. Leader sends command to all followers for replication
2. One or more followers encounter execution errors (non-fatal)
3. Enough followers succeed to maintain quorum and commit the command
4. Failed followers retain uncommitted log entries
5. When error condition clears, failed followers retry on next heartbeat
6. System achieves full consistency across all nodes

This handles real-world scenarios where temporary resource constraints, database locks, or other recoverable conditions might cause individual node failures without compromising overall cluster operation.
