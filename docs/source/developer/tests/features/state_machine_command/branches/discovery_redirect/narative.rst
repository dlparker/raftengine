This feature branch covers client command handling when the receiving node is not the 
current leader but discovers the current leader during the command processing.

**Raft Thesis Reference**: Section 6 (Client Interaction)

According to the Raft thesis, when a client sends a command to a non-leader node,
the node should redirect the client to the current leader. However, there are scenarios
where the node receiving the command was previously a leader but has since been replaced
due to network events.

The key behaviors tested in this feature branch:

1. **Leader Identity Discovery**: The former leader discovers it is no longer the leader
   when it attempts to process the command and realizes it lacks current authority

2. **Redirect Response**: Instead of attempting to process the command (which would fail),
   the node provides a redirect response pointing to the current leader

3. **Command Preservation**: The original command is not lost or corrupted during the
   redirect process

This differs from simple `request_redirect` scenarios because it involves a node that
believed it was the leader but discovers otherwise during command processing, rather
than a node that already knew it was a follower.

The implementation ensures that:
- No inconsistent state changes occur
- The client receives clear guidance on where to retry the command
- The cluster maintains consistency during leadership transitions

This behavior is essential for maintaining linearizability guarantees during network
partition recovery scenarios.
