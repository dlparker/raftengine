This feature branch validates the system's ability to handle errors that occur during state machine command execution, ensuring graceful error propagation and recovery mechanisms.

When a state machine command encounters an error during execution, the Raft system must handle this gracefully without compromising cluster consistency or availability. This includes detecting the error, preventing invalid state transitions, and providing appropriate feedback mechanisms.

**Key Validation Points**:

- **Error Detection**: System properly detects when state machine commands fail during execution
- **State Consistency**: Failed commands do not result in invalid state transitions or corrupt log entries
- **Error Propagation**: Errors are properly communicated back through the command processing pipeline
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: System can recover from command errors and continue normal operation
- **Transaction Safety**: Failed commands do not leave the system in an inconsistent state

**Error Handling Process**:
1. Command execution begins normally in state machine
2. Error condition is detected during processing
3. Error flag is set to indicate command failure
4. State transition is prevented or rolled back
5. Error information is propagated to calling context
6. System continues normal operation for subsequent commands

**Error Scenarios**:
- **Validation Errors**: Commands that fail input validation
- **Resource Errors**: Commands that fail due to resource constraints
- **Business Logic Errors**: Commands that violate application-specific rules
- **System Errors**: Commands that fail due to underlying system issues

**Implementation Testing**:
This feature tests the incomplete error reporting mechanism that allows state machine commands to catch errors and return indications of failure, particularly in follower nodes where error reporting back to client code is still being developed.
