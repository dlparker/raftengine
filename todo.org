1. [] Need to be able to remove a server from cluster without it running. This will be a new API call in
2. [] Need to reject node exit if only two nodes left. Really? Maybe we can allow a single node to lead
   a cluster for extreme circumstances? Yes, let's make that work. This would be especially usefull when
   constructing a new node. Imagine starting a server on one maching, going to the next and starting another
   and having it add itself to the cluster. Probably a good plan.
