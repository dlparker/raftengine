Update the raft_feature_identification_methodology.md plan to add the following steps:

1. Create the feature and feature branch definition files in the docs
   tree instead of the captures tree.  The location in the docs tree
   is docs/source/tests/features. There are already some files there
   following the directory layout pattern used by the generated test
   rst files. Add new files using the same pattern. Update the
   existing files if they need improvement.
2. Once the target test is updated with feature definition files and the tests pass,
   and the doc build script has been run (dev_tools/build_docs.py), the new
   test rst files need to be copied from the captures tree using the table below as a guide.


copy captures/test_traces/rst/(COLUMN 2) to COLUMN 3


| Test file name         | Capture RST               | Doc dir                                    |
| test_elections_1.py    | test_elections_1/*.rst    | docs/source/developer/tests/elections      |
| test_elections_2.py    | test_elections_2/*.rst    | docs/source/developer/tests/elections      |
| test_commands_1.py     | test_commands_1/*.rst     | docs/source/developer/tests/commands       |
| test_partions_1.py     | test_partions_1/*.rst     | docs/source/developer/tests/partitions     |
| test_snapshots.py      | test_snapshots/*.rst      | docs/source/developer/tests/snapshots      |
| test_member_changes.py | test_member_changes/*.rst | docs/source/developer/tests/member_changes |
| test_log_fiddles.py    | test_log_fiddles/*.rst    | docs/source/developer/tests/log_recovery   |
| test_class_edges.py    | test_class_edges/*.rst    | docs/source/developer/tests/edges          |
| test_msg_edges.py      | test_msg_edges/*.rst      | docs/source/developer/tests/edges          |
| test_events.py         | test_events/*.rst         | docs/source/developer/tests/events         |
| test_events.py         | test_events/*.rst         | docs/source/developer/tests/events         |
| test_timers_1.py       | test_timers_1/*.rst       | docs/source/developer/tests/timers         |
| test_random_code.py    | test_random_code/*.rst    | docs/source/developer/tests/random_code    |

copy captures/test_traces/plantuml/TEST_PATH*/test_name*.puml to docs/source/developer/tests/diagrams/TEST_PATH*
where TEST_PATH* is something like test_elections_1 or test_elections_2.

Add logic to build docs to perform these copy operations, but add argparse argument processing and make this step
optional.
