* Test test_empty_log_1 from file tests/test_log_fiddles.py


    Tests that a leader crash and recovery with an empty log eventually leads to a successful
    sync with the rest of the cluster.

    Test starts with normal election, then the leader is crashed, and election is run,
    and then the leader is restarted but with an empty log. The timer driven operations
    are then allowe to proceed until the leader is caught up and in sync.
    
    Timers are disabled during the first election, so during that phase
    all timer driven operations such as heartbeats are manually triggered.
    After the leader is crashed, timers are enabled and remain enabled for the rest
    of the test.

** Notes about interpreting traces
The way in which the traces are collected can occasionally obscure what is going on. A case in point is the commit of records at followers.
The commit process is triggered by an append_entries message arriving at the follower with a commitIndex value that exceeds the local
commit index, and that matches a record in the local log. This starts the commit process AFTER the response message is sent. You might
be expecting it to be prior to sending the response, in bound, as is often said. Whether this is expected behavior is not called out
as an element of the Raft protocol. It is certainly not required, however, as the follower doesn't report the commit index back to the
leader.

The definition of the commit state for a record is that a majority of nodes (leader and followers) have saved the record. Once
the leader detects this it applies and commits the record. At some point it will send another append_entries to the followers and they
will apply and commit. Or, if the leader dies before doing this, the next leader will commit by implication when it sends a term start
log record.

So when you are looking at the traces, you should not expect to see the commit index increas at a follower until some other message
traffic occurs, because the tracing function only checks the commit index at message transmission boundaries.
