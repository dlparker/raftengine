The previous changes were mostly correct. There is one small
issue that appears to be that some original lines are not
being filtered out by TraceFilter.

The run_test.sh shell script should be used to re-run the target test as specified below.
At completion, the test will produce two files from the trace data that has been
produced during the test run. The are:

1. captures/test_traces/json/test_elections_1/test_election_1.json
2. captures/test_traces/no_legen_org/test_elections_1/test_election_1.org
	 
These should be comparied against the equivalent files that were provided
as input 

1. ai_experiments/trials/grok3mini.cline.cmp_set_0.trial_1/test_election_1.json
2. ai_experiments/trials/grok3mini.cline.cmp_set_0.trial_1/test_election_1.org

The .json files will be differnt in some respects due to the ordering
of operations in the test and the fact that there are some timestamps
present. Therefore comparison should be limited to the "condensed"
properties of the TraceWrap objects. They should be identical.

The parts of the .org files comparison that matters is in the tables,
 which are constructed from the condensed data. They should be identical.

To run the test:
	 
./run_test.sh tests/test_elections_1.py::test_election_1


On comparing the .org files, I found some differences. One example
(not the only example) is provided here:

Expected (from the provided input .org file)

|  N-1   | N-1                         | N-1   | N-2   | N-2 | N-2   | N-3   | N-3 | N-3   |

Actual result:

Please analize the results and plan a fix if the problem can be identified.
