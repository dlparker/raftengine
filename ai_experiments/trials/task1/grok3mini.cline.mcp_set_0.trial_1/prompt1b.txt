File to Modify
dev_tools/trace_condenser.py

Description of the desired change:

   1. Split the condenser logic into Three classes:
      1. TraceFilter - processes trace_lines and decides which lines
	 to include in results, returns result list with only those lines
	 using same logic current found in TraceCondenser.condense()
      2. Shorthand - turns lists of NodeState objects into string versions
	 of the data as using the same technique as the current TraceCondenser.condense() method does
      3. A modified version of TraceCondenser that processes each TestSection by using TraceFilter
	 and Shorthand. Instances of these should be created as properties of the
	 class. In future revisions other classes that perform the same functions differently
	 will be optional possibilities. The results of these operations should be stored
	 in the TestSection condensed property just as it is currently.
      4. dev_tools/test_trace.py should be updated to call the new condenser.
      5. The run_test.sh shell script should be used to re-run the target test as specified below.
         At completion, the test will produce two files from the trace data that has been
	 produced during the test run. The are:

         1. captures/test_traces/json/test_elections_1/test_election_1.json
         2. captures/test_traces/no_legen_org/test_elections_1/test_election_1.org
	 
	 These should be comparied against the equivalent files that were provided
	 as input 

         1. ai_experiments/trials/grok3mini.cline.cmp_set_0.trial_1/test_election_1.json
	 2. ai_experiments/trials/grok3mini.cline.cmp_set_0.trial_1/test_election_1.org

	 The .json files will be different in some respects due to the ordering
	 of operations in the test and the fact that there are some timestamps
	 present. Therefore comparison should be limited to the "condensed"
	 properties of the TraceWrap objects. They should be identical.

	 The parts of the .org files comparison that matters is in the tables,
	 which are constructed from the condensed data. They should be identical.

         To run the test:
	 
	 ./run_test.sh tests/test_elections_1.py::test_election_1
