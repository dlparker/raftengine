I've reviewed the files as per the instructions: dev_tools/trace_data.py, ai_experiments/tracking/trial_1/test_election_1.json, and ai_experiments/tracking/trial_1/test_election_1.org. This provides a clear understanding of the trace data structure, including NodeState, TestSection, and the election process details.

Based on the desired changes, here's a detailed plan to modify dev_tools/trace_condenser.py by splitting the logic into three classes (TraceFilter, Shorthand, and a modified TraceCondenser), update dev_tools/test_trace.py, and verify with tests:

1. **Class Design**:
   - **TraceFilter**: This class will handle filtering trace_lines based on the current condense() logic. It will take trace_lines as input and return a filtered list, focusing on criteria like relevant events (e.g., role changes, message operations) from the trace data.
   - **Shorthand**: This class will convert lists of NodeState objects into condensed string representations, mirroring the string formatting in the existing condense() method. It will handle transformations like creating tabular strings for TestSection.condensed.
   - **Modified TraceCondenser**: This will be updated to compose the above classes as properties (e.g., self.filter = TraceFilter(), self.shorthand = Shorthand()). For each TestSection, it will use TraceFilter to process lines and Shorthand to generate the condensed output, then store the result in TestSection.condensed.

2. **File Modifications**:
   - In dev_tools/trace_condenser.py, refactor the condense() method:
     - Extract filtering logic into TraceFilter.
     - Extract string conversion logic into Shorthand.
     - Update the main TraceCondenser class to instantiate and use these classes sequentially.
   - In dev_tools/test_trace.py, update calls to TraceCondenser to ensure they invoke the new class structure, such as passing data through the filtered and shorthand processes before generating output.

3. **Testing and Verification**:
   - After changes, run the test using ./run_test.sh tests/test_elections_1.py::test_election_1.
   - Compare the produced JSON and ORG files against the originals (e.g., ai_experiments/tracking/trial_1/test_election_1.json and .org) to ensure no regressions.

This plan maintains modularity for future extensions, as mentioned in the instructions. If you'd like any adjustments or have additional details, let me know. Once this is finalized, you can toggle to Act mode to implement it.
