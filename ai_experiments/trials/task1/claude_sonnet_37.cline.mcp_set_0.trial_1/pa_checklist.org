* Planned Action Checklist: <Action ID>
  This checklist guides the execution of a single planned action.

  - [ ] Prepare prompt
    - [ ] Retrieve the generic prompt from the Planned Actions File.
    - [ ] If needed, modify the prompt for the variant (e.g., add agent-specific instructions).
    - [ ] Save the final prompt in the tracking directory (`prompts/<action_id>.org`).
    - [ ] Validate the prompt by reviewing it for clarity and completeness.
  - [ ] Prepare report document
    - [ ] Create a report file (`reports/<action_id>.org`) in the tracking directory.
    - [ ] Include sections for: prompt used, agent response, code changes, test results, and observations.
  - [ ] Execute the action
    - [ ] Run the prompt with the selected agent/API.
    - [ ] For each attempt:
      - [ ] Save the agent’s response in the report file.
      - [ ] If the changes are accepted:
        - [ ] Apply the changes to the codebase.
        - [ ] Run tests to verify functionality.
        - [ ] Commit the changes to the trial branch with a descriptive message.
        - [ ] Record the degree of completeness (e.g., 100% if fully successful, 50% if partial).
        - [ ] Update the cost tracking file with any new API usage data.
      - [ ] If the changes are not accepted:
        - [ ] Record the reason (e.g., “Incorrect implementation”, “Test failure”, “Prompt unclear”).
        - [ ] If minor tweak needed, adjust the prompt and retry (return to “Execute the action”).
        - [ ] If major issue, create a new planned action:
          - [ ] Add the new action to the Planned Actions File.
          - [ ] Generate a new checklist for the action.
          - [ ] Link the new action to the current one in the report for traceability.
  - [ ] Finalize action
    - [ ] Summarize the outcome in the report (success, partial success, failure).
    - [ ] Update the variants file with the action’s results (e.g., completeness, issues encountered).
    - [ ] Commit the report and any updated files to the trial branch.
