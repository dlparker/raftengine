write a prompt for the first trial and make sure that the instructions make enough sense that
we can proceed to comparative iterations.

Orignal instructions:


1. Run the target test to produce the capture files:
   ./run_test.sh tests/test_elections_1.py::test_election_1
   1. captures/test_traces/json/test_elections_1/test_election_1.json
   2. captures/test_traces/no_legen_org/test_elections_1/test_election_1.org
   3. Save the capture files somewhere so they won't be overwritten
2. The files needed to inform the prompt
   1. dev_tools/trace_data.py
   2. dev_tools/trace_condenser.py
   3. a saved copy of test_election_1.json
   4. a saved copy of test_election1.org
3. Description of the desired change
   1. Split the condenser logic into Three classes:
      1. TraceFilter - processes trace_lines and decides which lines
	 to include in results, returns result list with only those lines
	 using same logic current found in TraceCondenser.condense()
      2. ShortestShorthand - turns lists of NodeState objects into string versions
	 of the data as using the same technique as the current TraceCondenser.condense() method does
      3. A modified version of TraceCondenser that processes each TestSection by using TraceFilter
	 and ShortedShorthand. Instances of these should be created as properties of the
	 class. In future revisions other classes that perform the same functions differently
	 will be optional possibilities. The results of these operations should be stored
	 in the TestSection condensed property just as it is currently.
      4. dev_tools/test_trace.py should be updated to call the new condenser.
      5. the run_test.sh shell script should be used to re-run the target test, the json and
	 org capture files produced should match the originals

	 ./run_test.sh tests/test_elections_1.py::test_election_1

	 

Update 1:

After trying grok3mini with cline and no mcp servers, I have found that my code has a nice land mine that blew it up.
Not looking to complete task, just looking to see how other models/etc handle the mine with the same instructions.
