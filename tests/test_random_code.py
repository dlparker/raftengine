# Stuff in here is just things that help me develop tests by writing
# explority code that runs in the test context, just to figure out
# what will work before adding it to real code.
# I might keep old code around for a while by renaming the test so
# it won't be gathered, then remove it when I am sure there is no
# more need for it.
