1. Move cProfile stuff to a class in rpc_ops.rpc_server.py that turns on and off
   by local_command, writes out to a file named from an argument to the command.

2. Make a runner that starts the servers, runs the dist_perf for a number of
   iterations to produce a table of results, 1, 2, 3, etc until the clients
   begin to return errors. Get some output at each step so we can tell what is
   happening, output to json. Build a tool like analyze_performance that
   reads a single json and produces report, or multiple jsons and produces
   a comparison report.

3. Branch the raftengine code, try converting messages to msgspec. Maybe claude
   can do this.
