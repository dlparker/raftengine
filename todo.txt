   Want to implement them as opt in features, segregate tests

60. Cluster change protocol

Library Features:

41. rough out ideas for cluster class
    1. Knows about "static config" provided at startup. Can be programatically changed? See thesis
    2. Knows about "dynamic config" resulting from cluster changes while running. See thesis
    3. teach candidate and leader to use it. See thesis

10. Think about providing an optional uri map implementation for users. If provided, need to think
    about how to use it in API calls to let users know the "real" address

6. Think deep about reporting errors in raft code, and detecting them in testing. Break something
   such as rejected append entries and fiddle. Maybe can use substate stuff to alert to error
   and give pilot an api entry on hull to call to get errors? This is kinda partly done in the
   client command execution code. Maybe we need an Error class set and a local log feature?
